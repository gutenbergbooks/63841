</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>To</span> look at the fellow one would never
give him credit for half the grit he has,”
thought Strange as he glanced round for
a cab at the street corner. “If I had money
I should send him to Paris,” he went
on as soon as he had settled himself
comfortably, “the Kensington methods are
no manner of use to him. It’s the deuce
of a shame too, that he has to attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>finished work for a living when he should
be swatting over the primaries; and that
colour mania—that will get chronic and
overgrow him, and then God help him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As it happened Lady Mary was at home
and quite wide-awake. As a rule this
was not the case until much later in the
day, but just now various things combined
to keep off sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Strange was announced, she
was sitting well screened from the small
bright fire, gazing in soft meditation at
her plump white hands, with the corners
of her mouth slightly drawn downwards,
and her smooth round forehead
wrinkled up in a way that would have
gone to the heart of a stone to see in
such a picture of comfort as she was
made to be.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“Humphrey!” she exclaimed, making a
vain try at a spring and flopping down
again limply, “Humphrey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Myself and no other,” said Strange,
receiving her kiss cheerfully, and settling
himself into a chair after he had shaken
it to see if it would bear. “I needn’t
ask you how you are, Aunt Moll, you look
just as you always did, like a catkin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A what, Humphrey?” she enquired
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A catkin, we used to call them goslings,
soft, oval, pale gold, silky, fluffy masses—you
have a weakness for adjectives I know,
judging from the line in literature you
patronize. The harshest wind has never
been known to ruffle a gosling, it always
skips them, they always feel warm to the
touch, as if the sun were on them, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>are delicious things. The sun is always on
you, Aunt Moll, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, Humphrey, you little know, you
can make but a faint guess at my troubles,
the death of my dear——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aunt Moll, we’ll skip that!” interrupted
Strange, with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew quite well what an unmixed
relief the deceased peer’s removal was
to all his kith and kin, more especially
to his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you recollect, before I went to Algeria
we agreed to let my uncle rest undisturbed
in his present retreat, which, from what
we know of his past, must be unexceptionable—whatever
his faults may have
been no one can deny that he was a
most exclusive person and had a very just
notion of his position.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“Dear Humphrey! That flippancy! I
had hoped that the many dangers you
have experienced, the many times you
have come face to face with death—and,
Humphrey—with <em>Eternity</em>—would have
brought the seriousness of life before your
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aunt Moll, the sight of you there in
that chair brings that view of the case
more clearly before me than ever the sight
of death did.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Mary again looked anxious, her
nephew always made her feel like that,
his eyes seemed to rake her from stem
to stern and to find some mute amusement
in the process. Suddenly she gave a little
start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have I been thinking of?” she
murmured. “Humphrey,” she began again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“we must speak of your prospects.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was bubbling over with them as
it happened, besides, they would keep him
off her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you thinking of doing now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What I have always been thinking of
doing and have never done yet, making
the result of my face to face encounters
with death—<em>and Eternity</em>—of some
practical value to the world in general
and to myself in particular, by filling my
trousers’ pockets, which at this present
moment contain one pound six and threepence,
and that’s mostly due for beer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey! Have you heard nothing?
Your letters?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never read them. For Heaven’s
sake, speak, divulge, I’m ready for anything!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Your great-uncle is dead—died last
month. Before he went he confessed a
heavy sin that had lain for years on his
soul, poor dear creature. That great lanky
son of his, about whom, as you know, I
always had a nasty feeling, as if he were
not altogether quite right, as if somehow
he was not one of us. This now proves
to have been a quite prophetic instinct,
he turns out to be—ahem—illegitimate,
and you, you, Humphrey, are the heir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I say! It’s beastly hard lines on
Tom!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange was quite as staggered with
the news, as any other younger son in
his condition would have been. It vibrated
through and through him, but as one cannot
clothe thunder in harmonies any more
than one can a tumultuous muddle of sensations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in speech in the presence of a woman
inclined to gush and stoutness, he swallowed
his muddle and was flippant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey!” said Lady Mary with
dignity, wondering a little if Humphrey
himself were quite right. “This minute
you have ten thousand a year, and you,
my nephew, are Sir Humphrey Strange.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am I? You’ll be astonished to hear
I don’t feel a bit like it, I feel exactly
as I did before. Is there any difference
to the naked eye, if so, do you mind telling
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Mary stirred uneasily and crossed
her hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear Humphrey!” she cried at last,
with a soft wailing bleat, “I confess I
did expect some show of proper feeling
from you on this occasion. It is a shock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>to me to see you in your present frame
of mind, it seems like flying in the face
of Providence, and may end in bringing
down a judgment on your head.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Mary sighed and continued, lowering
her voice to a coo, “When I heard the
news, Humphrey, I went down on my knees
and prayed that my poor sinful uncle might
be forgiven for foisting that counterfeit
young man off on our family, and that
you, my nephew, might face your responsibilities
with a seriousness befitting the
occasion. My dear, if you knew what
it costs me to kneel, now that I have
grown a little stout, you might perhaps
appreciate this act.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Humphrey grinned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aunt Moll, my feelings are always
too deep for expression, it would upset
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>you for a month if I were to give
you the merest glimpse of the emotions
that are ravaging me this minute. These
inward upheavals are frightfully wasting,
your acts of prayer and thanksgiving are
a fool to them—There doesn’t happen to
be any tea going, does there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tea! Is it five o’clock? What can
have happened? Pray ring. The misery
I have to <a id='end'></a>endure with servants! I wonder
my hair isn’t even greyer than it is, and
my poor face more worn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your hair is as brown as a nut, and
there isn’t a crease in your dear, soft
young face. What was wrong with you
when I came in, the corners of your
mouth were turned the wrong way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Mary reflected as she made his
tea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Ah, it was Gwen, she has thrown
aside another most unexceptionable match,
the third in three months.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, what?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen Waring, she is with me for
the season.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, that queer, sulky, imperturbable,
long-legged girl, belonging to those wonderful
young fossils at Waring Park. I
shouldn’t have thought she’d have got the
chance to throw over any match, let alone
three unexceptionable ones——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s up? Gru!—”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tall superb girl with a face like a
hothouse flower, was standing in the middle
of the room, looking at him with a cool
aloofness that made his blood run cold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>She had heard every word, she must
have, his voice was a big one.</p>

<p class='c000'>This magnificent dominant creature, before
whom he felt as a worm, was only
an enlarged completed edition of the “sulky,
long-legged” slip he used to catch fitful
glances of, in his stays with his aunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>If only he hadn’t classified her in such
cool pleasant tones! It was not often
the fellow felt at such a disadvantage.
If the girl had made a joke now, or even
looked as if she could make one! But she
knew better than to joke, she had her
tactics ready to her hand, and she was
determined his impertinence should be
brought home to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her own classification never troubled
her in the least, it was the good-humoured
sneer at her parents which touched her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Was she always to suffer for being the
product of such a house?</p>

<p class='c000'>The next few minutes Strange felt
younger than he had done for ten years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lady Mary has been telling me of
your good fortune,” she remarked kindly,
sipping her tea, and looking at him in as
motherly a way as so very splendid a
person could look. “You must be quite
excited—I suppose you are already making
a hundred plans?</p>

<p class='c000'>“I seem to know you quite well,”
she went on, not giving him the chance
to reply, “Lady Mary is always telling
anecdotes of ‘her boy’, very entertaining
ones they are too, and I should fancy
characteristic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She helped herself to more cream and
regarded him coolly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“When she reads prayers, she always
makes a special and very full mention
of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Mary winced abjectly and looked
deprecatingly at her nephew, but his eyes
were fastened on Gwen. His aunt felt she
had escaped for once. She settled herself
into her pillows, and wondered vaguely
what would happen next.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had a horrid feeling that there
were breakers ahead somewhere, but
as she never by any chance could see
farther than her own nose, she decided
not to make any effort at sighting them,
but to drift on with faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very considerate of my aunt!” said
Strange, in a pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, that is only one instance of her
consideration and the least important. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>has done much more than that for you,
she is like John the Baptist without the
skins and locusts, she has ‘been preparing
the way before’ you, and you have only to
appear to be mobbed, Sir Humphrey. There’s
not a matron nor a maid in London who
doesn’t babble of you; your name is rippling
off a hundred tongues at this very minute;
you are the hero of a hundred teas. All
this came on after a long round of calls
Lady Mary and I paid last Monday,” she
continued, scanning him. “I had only
heard your name before, in the outward
world, that is—the Baronetcy never affected
Lady Mary’s prayers and anecdotes, they
were always with us—in a queer aside
way, as if one hinted at dark things that
had better not be unearthed. Ah, but
that is all changed! You have no notion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>though how exhausting the process has
been to Lady Mary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stopped at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he said, looking at his aunt,
“I certainly hadn’t perceived any symptoms
of a cave-in about her. Monday, did you
say, Miss Waring? Would you mind letting
me have your visiting list for that day,
Aunt Moll? I suppose I know some of
the people, and my soul’s one desire for
years has been to pose as an afternoon-tea
hero. I shall just have time to get
a foretaste of the joys this afternoon.
Good-bye, Aunt Moll, pray don’t look
anxious on my account, my morals are
tough enough to run the gauntlet of all
the teas in London, and my digestion is
unimpaired. Good-bye, Miss Waring,” he
said, bowing gravely in her direction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“thank you for standing by my aunt on
Monday’s warpath, I am gratified to see
<em>you</em> are in no sort of way exhausted by
the process. Damnation!” he muttered
as he got out into the street, “she
smells of a hothouse with her overpowering
beauty and her insolent airs,
and that cool inexorable way of hers.
Oh, Aunt Moll, you’ll rue the day you
made me a by-word. To think I had
to swallow all that, and let a girl bait
me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so I am the coming <em>parti</em>! Good
Lord! I’ll be fine practice for the ‘sport,’
anyway they’ll find me shy game. I’ll
go home, finish a chapter or two, dose
Tolly, and then I’ll dine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hullo!” he exclaimed suddenly, “things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>are looking up for Charlie, he can go
to Paris now when he likes. I wonder
how I can reduce his high stomach to
seeing it in that light!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Strange</span> found the preliminaries of his
induction into the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> of an English
Squire even more unpleasant than he had
expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the period when he had read
Roman law and knocked about the Courts
with the hope of supplementing his
income by the experience he picked up
there, the technicalities of the law had
bored him to excruciation point. Now,
when they were brought specially to bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>on him he found them more galling still,
but being a wise man in his way, he
shirked none of them, and took good care
not to take a solitary step in the dark,
till, by the time they had got him
off their hands, the solicitors of the
Stranges were in a position to congratulate
themselves at last, on the fact of
having found a whole man in the family.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had gone the rounds of his duties
doggedly and had found them insufferably
dull, he had been down to Strange Hall,
had left things there in trim, and had
now flown back to London.</p>

<p class='c000'>One afternoon in June he was standing
in the shadow of a deep window, in one
of his rooms in Piccadilly, lazily sharpening
a pencil.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>He had plenty of work to do, but
somehow he had no stomach for it, the
change in his life had got into his bones,
and had filled him with unrest and a
certain loss of faith in himself. When
at last after a long meditation, the truth
of this broke upon him, it came with an
audible and ample, “Damn!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I may as well give it up and amuse
myself in a mild way,” he thought, after
a hasty review of matters, “nothing can
be too weak and vapid for my present
condition—I feel flabby.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A mild grunt at his back made him
swing round. It was Tolly, just back from
the dentist, of a deeper puce than usual, and
with a terrible uncompromising row of
glistening teeth shooting out aggressively
between his thin lips.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>He gave a deferential duck, and stood
on approval, with a laboured attempt at
an appearance of modest deprecation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Turn round, Tolly,” said his master,
“away from me, I can’t bear it all at
once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was shaking with silent laughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you feel about them yourself,
Tolly?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fust-rate, sir—your wussup.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Since his master’s rise in life he was
much exercised as to the best terms by
which to give him honour, and he varied
them daily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can bite nails, your wussup.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! You mustn’t play fast and loose
with these tusks as you might with ones
bred and reared on the premises.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord! your wussup, I wouldn’t make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>that free, being, as they are your property,
sir, besides, any fool can see as how they
be the real bought article, money down,
not your everyday common grinders.
There weren’t a toff I met as didn’t
mention ’em, I tried to keep ’em dark,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall expect a good deal more from
you,” said Strange, pointing the moral,
“now you’re complete. If anyone calls to-day
say I’m out and I won’t be home
till night, and—take these to the post
before I start,” he pointed to a big
heap of notes on the table, “and don’t
drop any of them, nor swallow your
teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twenty invitations in a week,” reflected
Tolly’s master, “the first-fruits of my rise in
life! they used to average six a week. I’ll go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and see Lady Mary. Damn it all, why
need a man lie to himself, I’ll go and
see Miss Waring!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he went, and somehow the next
day he went again, and the next, and the
next after that. Then he and Gwen
discovered a mutual passion for riding,
not up and down the Row, that seemed
as tame a pastime to the one as to the
other, but in the early mornings out on the
heath at Hampstead, or sometimes far out
on the Surrey side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once they went as far as Surbiton,
where they got drenched in a shower
and had to take refuge and have tea in
an old inn.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is not at all to be supposed
that with all this intimacy those two
got an inch nearer one another, they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>intellectual companions, nothing more, not
even to be called comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen neither evaded nor shirked conventions,
she simply swept them aside, as
she did her lovers. As for Strange, he felt her
and the rides very distinctly a boon. She
was an excellent flint to make sparks
with, her ways of thought were so new,
let alone startling, her modes of expression
so quaint, her tongue so remarkably
sharp, and she had such a brutal habit
of speaking undiluted truths. For the once
the two agreed, they disagreed at least
three times, and a good pitched battle had
to be fought to settle any question. The
sponge was never by any chance thrown
up, it was forced out of the hand of one
or of the other of them. It was a most
bracing and delightful experience for Gwen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>it was so satisfactory and so absolutely
free from mawkishness, and she reflected,
with superb self-congratulation, that the
man had just as little capacity for that
phase as herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s hard—hard as nails,” he reflected
after an evening at Lady Mary’s, “and
yet, she wasn’t made like that, I could
swear. I wonder what the devil’s wrong
with her eyes, and what’ll put them right?
I believe, upon my word I do, that a
baby might do the business for her. There’s
not a man living that would have any
effect upon them, and yet there are fellows
going who would take that dewiness, for
softness, hang it! it’s mere moisture, but—ah,
well, the effect is magnificent!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took out his watch, but his hand
shook so that he could not open it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“God forgive me!” he muttered, “this is
awful! I have had a good deal in the way
of education at women’s hands, but this is a
new experience,” he remarked after a pause,
grinning, and flicking a spot of ash off his
coat, “her want of self-consciousness is
next to ghastly, it has an uncanny sexless
sort of air about it that gives one the
shivers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The intellectual companionship continued
unabated for ten more days, then one
evening at the end of June, Gwen Waring
told Strange that she and Lady Mary were
going down into the country early in
July.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he got home that night he had
a difficulty in mounting the stairs. When
he succeeded, he got himself to the glass, and
found he was white to the lips. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>had a shock—he had discovered, as he had
turned out of Lady Mary’s softly-lighted
hall into the street, that he loved the
girl irretrievably, and with the knowledge
came fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few minutes he leaned against
the mantel-piece, his head sunk into his
hands, then he raised himself with a sigh,
threw off his light overcoat, and sat down
to smoke, but he couldn’t draw a puff,
then it struck him that he was numb with
cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at the grate with a purpose
to make a fire lighting in his eyes,
but with a shrug he shirked the trouble.
He could not go to bed, that was out of
the question; as for sitting there freezing,
that was just as impossible. He must
move, he must feel the life stir in him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>again. He stood up and shook himself, then
a thought struck him, he hurried to his
room, changed his clothes, and went out
round the corner to the mews where he
kept the horses he had brought up from
Strange Hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the gear, saddled the freshest,
and rode away through short cuts
and byways, away from the noise and
hurly-burly, out into the quiet of the
country. Then he drew rein, pulled the
mare aside on to a green strip flanking
the road, and let her go her own pace.
For a long time he gave her grace and
smoked savagely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is about the most killing blow that
could have fallen on a man. It would be
bad for any fellow; but for me, who can
love if I can do anything, to have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>pour it all out at the feet of a girl who
couldn’t understand what love, much less
passion, means, to save her life! It’s a
beastly backhanded stroke of fate, and I
don’t know that I’ve ever done anything
bad enough to deserve it. Lord, how the
mare’s sides smoke! I must have ridden
like a maniac. The worst of it is, this
isn’t a thing one can clear off and forget—with
the woman right in one’s soul!—the
fine, grand, proud creature! God! it’s
almost sacrilege to expect her to love, with
love in the beastly state it is—to love
any man-Jack of us; it’s honour enough
to love her and yet,—yet,—when a man
has once done it, done it once and for
ever, the only thing in life seems to be
to get something in return. What commercial
brutes we are even in this holiest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>connection of all! But let her love or not,
I’ll give her my love if she’ll take it and I
shall pick up crumbs like old Lazarus.—Pah,
how she dominates one!—Ah, and when
<em>her</em> love wakes up—but, the devil! suppose
another fellow is the instrument chosen!
Ah!—ah! hold up, mare, are you stumbling
or am I reeling? It’s myself, by Jove,
God help us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Involuntarily he drove his spurs into
the beast, she started forward angrily,
unused to maniacs. Presently he came to
his senses and pulled her up with a drag
on her mouth that she did not forget for
some time. She went sulky and stumbled
for the next mile, small blame to her!
A Christian would have done more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually her master’s face cleared
itself and softened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Perhaps,” he muttered, “perhaps
no other fellow after all, but—who
knows?—a baby’s tender little mouth
may do it.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> Strange got back to town, after
baiting man and beast at a little inn on
the outskirts of Weybridge, Tolly’s greeting,
which was blasphemous and amazed,
and the unusual look in his green eyes,
caused his master to glance at himself in
the glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heaven!” he thought, turning away,
“I’m a nice object to go courting! One
would think I had just emerged from D.T.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>or Bedlam! Tolly, turn on the hot water,
empty a bottle of vinegar into it, and
put out clean clothes for me. I feel like
jelly. Good Lord! has love this limping
effect often?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned into his bedroom. As he
was wrestling with one of his shirt buttons
he muttered,</p>

<p class='c000'>“However this goes, it’s a toss-up
what the gain will be, heaven or hell.
Well, a man might do worse than face
hell for her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had hardly made this heroic remark
when the absurdity of it struck him;
he laughed aloud. “I had better face
my bath,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he was washed and dressed, he
rather thought of the Club and a good
lunch, but the game didn’t seem worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the candle. He felt that his hands were
quite sufficiently full with one woman, he
had no desire for men, more especially
at feeding-time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall have my lunch here,” he
said, looking up from his paper, “get
out some bread and cheese, and beer,
and anything else you can lay your
hands on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In five minutes Tolly had covered a
little round table with a cloth, and had
set out on it a mixed assortment of
cheese, beer, jam, and a freshly-opened
tin of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foie gras</span></i>, and he stood proudly
in attendance with napkin on arm, keeping
down with difficulty a grin of self-satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>However full he was of himself, Strange
never let a new accomplishment of Tolly’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>escape him, if he did, the effect on the
boy would have been disastrous. No sinner
ever strove after God as this sinner after
his owner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well done, Tolly, you’ll shine in life
yet, the way you flourish that damask
is sublime!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beggin’ your pardon, your wussup,”
said Tolly, “Bill, the groom, ’e were
round after ye, a-stormin’ at me because
the horse was out. Bill always lets out
at me like when he feels hisself put
about in his mind, and he thought you
and the beast were lost,” sniggered Tolly.
“I told him you was big enough to take
care of yourself, and that gents often finds
the nights more convenienter than the
days,” he remarked confidentially, pushing
the salt under his master’s nose. “Bill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>is that ignorant, sir, of loife and sich, he
erstonishes me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange drank his beer with a look at
the half-made creature who had plumbed
‘loife’ from the vantage ground of her
sewers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very like his betters,” he thought,
“we get lots of our views from a vantage
ground not one whit sweeter or cleaner
than Tolly’s.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He made a fresh dive into the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</span></i>
and his thoughts broke out on a new
track.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we’re going off somehow.
I believe it is a good deal the women’s
fault; this new craze for advanced talk
between the sexes is no good, the women
who affect it are never clever enough
nor good enough to make a success of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the thing, it’s a pose mostly, as their
smoking is, just done for effect.—Tolly,
pass that jam!”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had rounded off his meal with
a hunch of bread and strawberry jam, he
stretched himself, went to the window
and looked out, drumming gently on the
pane.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder,” he thought, “I wonder if
I am quite a fool or not, but—but, God!
how I love her!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he stopped drumming, and began
to wonder vaguely how in the name
of Heaven he was able to eat great
hunches of bread and jam not five minutes
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned and watched Tolly through
the door, devouring at his ease, with a sudden
shock of disgust, more at himself than at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the fellow, with his hideous mouth all
moist and jammy. He turned again to
the window and tried to steady his brain,
but it reeled and everything in the room
swam before him, he dropped his head in
his hands and trembled from head to foot,
when he raised it he felt steadier and
not so raging hot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall chance it,” he said, “I shall
chance it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he reached Lady Mary’s he was
in a much more wholesome frame of mind.
He had gone there by roundabout ways,
where he saw a good deal of stark,
staring, naked humanity; this helped to
crystallize his emotions, to sift the dross
out and leave the clean stuff.</p>

<p class='c000'>He never in his life felt clearer-headed
than when he went up the stairs unannounced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and paused to look through the half
opened door at Gwen, sitting near a
window in a cloudy dress of soft yellow
crêpey stuff and with her strong, long-fingered,
composed hands lying idle in her
lap and the guard dropped from her eyes,
showing a good deal more of herself than
he had ever seen before.</p>

<p class='c000'>He only paused for one minute, he had
no right yet to the girl’s secrets; then
he threw open the door with a little
bang and brought her back to the
present.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, is it you?” she said with the
ghost of a start, looking up at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>She felt in a vague way that he knew
more of her in that one minute than he
had any business to do, and she was not
quite sure if she liked it or not. He did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>not offer to shake hands with her but
glanced round the room silently. Gwen
laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are looking for Lady Mary? She
has a bad headache, an abnormally bad
one, and won’t be down till five.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He offered up a dumb thanksgiving and
sat down carefully, then he felt a horrible
desire to say, “Hem!” or to mention the
deuce or the weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had felt intensely reasonable the
minute before, but he was confused by
the beauty of the girl sitting so close to
him, with the flickering sunshine running
golden threads in and out her twisted
russet hair, and clothing her in pale
molten gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She shall have nothing to add to
her beauty,” he thought, “I shall not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>make a beast of myself to desire the
least of her when it is the greatest I
want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He started up, and asked if he might
draw down the blinds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Gwen wonderingly, as she
saw his big brown hand tremble on the
blind line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a sudden certainty of his intention
came upon her with a burst of angry
horror, but she swept this off and waited
coolly, with a sort of sneering excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange drew his chair farther forward
and sat facing her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Waring,” he said, “I have come
to ask if you will listen to the shady side
of a man’s life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no more tremble or hesitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>about him now, he looked as cool as
she did.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a side that men as a rule keep
to themselves and to their male companions,
no matter how near a man and a woman
come to each other, this impalpable barrier
keeps them apart. This has always struck
me as a rather low form of lie and
distinctly dishonourable, especially practised,
as it is, by the stronger on the presumably
weaker. If a woman is not strong
and pure and magnanimous enough to
bear this knowledge, a man should find
it out and go his way before he has
dared to touch her life; if she is
strong enough she should be given the
opportunity of gaining this knowledge at
first hand, and taking her subsequent
course accordingly. You are immeasurably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>nobler than any other woman who has
crossed my path.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Involuntarily he lowered his head as he
spoke, in a reverential way that touched
Gwen and forced her to hear him. After
the first disgusted shock her impulse had
been to send him about his business. She
had half risen from her seat on the spur
of this impulse, but somehow she had sat
down again, and in spite of herself she
had let him speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No decent man could deceive you,”
he went on, “even if every word he
spoke were to cut his own throat. May
I speak to you as man to man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He watched the palpitations of her
throat—which unfortunately were beyond
her control—with a sort of choking sensation—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Or more,” he added simply, “as if you
were God.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s colour neither increased nor left
her, she neither trembled nor stirred. For
a minute she was quite silent except for
one quick little swallowing sound, she was
fighting with a concentrated restrained
frenzy of despair against her fate, against
the overpowering longing to hear this man,
as he sat there ready to spoil his own
life sooner than lie to her even in a
fashion recognized by the use of generations.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was quite aware she had nothing
whatsoever to give him in exchange, she
knew perfectly well she was about to do
him a grievous wrong, and yet her whole
being was concentrated into one imperative
demand to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“You may speak,” she said in a hard
emotionless voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he told her simply, with neither
condonation nor reservation, the whole
truth about his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is all very well to talk glibly about
the advantages of calling a spade a spade,
but when it comes to giving dozens of
spades their unvarnished titles in the
presence of one virgin clean woman, and
when every fresh spade may be about to
dig up the heart you would foster, the
matter is no joke.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time that Strange had arrived
at the end of his unadorned record, his
smooth, brick-dust cheeks looked gray
and haggard, and his voice sounded tired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once during the recital Gwen had lost
guard over herself and had let a flash of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>half-triumphant interest escape from her
eyes. It was when he had said—“Thank
Heaven! I never loved one of these women,
that is, taking love in its all-round, large
sense.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had finished he stood up and
looked at her, waiting.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had herself still in her power, she
felt, with a wild leap of her spirit, she
could yet ward off her fate and his; “his,”
she thought with a wave of soft unaccustomed
pity. She had nothing to give
this man, nothing, not even the germs of
a possible something—something called
Love.</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed aloud and looked in his
face when the empty word stirred her
brain, then she lowered her eyes and
turned all her thoughts in on herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>moving a small pearl ring up and down
her finger with a swift rhythmic movement.—This
man would take her for
mere hope—hope that had no foundation
in fact,—it was a mean exchange,
nothing for everything,—mean and unjust;
for the minute she was hideous to herself,
with her own whole life a protest
against the injustice of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at him again, and a horrible
power seemed to drag and bind her to
him, she turned her eyes away angrily
and made a little involuntary sound of
trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, if I only could treat him as I
did the others!” she muttered under her
breath, “but I can’t, I can’t!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was frightened at herself—at the
power which drove her to the man inexorably,—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>looked at the door and
stirred in her seat, half-rising, but she
sat down again and began to move her
ring with the old movement, only quicker
and with tenser fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a cold feeling of finality came
on her, she knew she must say something
and she knew she was going to say
the wrong thing; an inexplicable smile
flickered across her face and touched her
mouth, she grew quite calm and ceased
to move her ring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have done me a very high
honour,” she said; “thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He came nearer and looked down
on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have tried to be perfectly honest,”
he said, “and you have no idea what
an awful grind it has been. It would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>quite impossible for me to give you any
idea of how I honour you, and as for
love—” he stopped, breathing hard,
“I have a heart full for you, dear, I
don’t think I know myself how much I
love you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl looked at him curiously, the
simple intensity of his manner struck her,
then her eyes fell and she sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Love is such a mere name to me,”
she said, “it seems such a collapsable
bubbly thing and put to such feeble uses.
You want me to be your wife then, and
you offer me a whole heart full of love,
whatever that may mean. I must be
honest too, and tell you that I shouldn’t
know how to dispose of a whole heart
full of love. I know nothing at all practically
about the matter, and theoretically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>it has never interested me. My situation is
hard to explain,” she exclaimed, with a
petulant sweeping movement of her hand,
“in the face of all this I want to accept your
offer, I don’t know why, I really believe
it is not I, Gwen Waring, that wants
this, it is something outside me that wants
it for me. I never felt so impersonal in
all my life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He winced, her honesty, to say the least
of it, was a trifle bald.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps I am more concerned in it
than I think,” she went on with a queer
intense serenity, dissecting herself audibly,
“I like new sensations, I am curious,
most things are so flat and boring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange started forward and was about
to speak, she raised her hand imperiously.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Stop!” she cried, “I must finish, I
want you quite clearly to understand that
if I take you at your word and become
your wife—wife,” she repeated, “how
astonishing the word sounds in connection
with me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed in an untranslatable way
and went on,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Remember and understand that I am
doing it as an experiment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He flushed, it was his own precise
thought but it seemed less hideous when
thought than when spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An experiment,” she repeated, “but
whether it is fair to try experiments in
lives is another matter. I wish—” she
cast a half-wistful, half-provoked look at
him, “I wish you were sufficiently clear
and reasonable yourself to help me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>answer the question—I am so ignorant
in these matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A sudden crimson rushed to her cheeks,
she was furious. What right had she to
blush like a dairy-maid and mislead the man?</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m not blushing properly, as girls ought
to blush,” she explained, “I am merely
angry, I feel caught in a trap. Why can’t
I tell you to begone and leave me at
peace?” she demanded, looking at him
with curious swift repulsion, “I have
never found any difficulty before,—why
don’t you help me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of his love, Strange shook with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no laughing matter for Gwen,
she kept her eyes fixed on him, angry
and full of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You stand there and laugh—laugh! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>wish to mercy I could. Don’t you know
I am going to accept you—I, who
don’t know what love means—I, who
am, I believe, sexless, don’t you know
you’re mad and don’t you think it’s rather
degrading to give all you offer me for
nothing? After all, it is not absolutely
necessary to my salvation that I should
make experiments on you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She felt a sudden tiredness come on
her and nestled back in her cushions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am ready to take you with open
eyes, Gwen; you are very honest, dear;
you will lose some of that when you have
suffered a little,” he added, with a ring
of sadness in his voice, as he looked
tenderly down on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She raised her head quickly. “Suffer!
Why should I suffer?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>He watched her for a minute with
sombre eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” he said half-absently,
“but you will. Then this is our betrothal,
is it, dear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She bowed her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my darling!” he said suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will he often say it?” she thought
curiously, “can I stand this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My darling, you have no idea how I
shall enjoy giving you lessons in love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you?” she said grimly, “I doubt
it, I tell you I have no taste for the
cult. Well, it is at least fortunate that
one can be honest and that it isn’t
necessary for me to befool you for the
sake of your income. This marriage is
the very perfection of an alliance from
all such points of view, and yet—do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>you know, Sir Humphrey, I wish quite
intensely, we were both of us in another
position, in quite a low, unknown one, then
we need not marry. Engagements are
nothing; I know as much of you
now as any engagement can teach me.
We might then try a preliminary experiment
as to how life together goes; if it
did not do, we might each go our own
way and bury the past. I never wished
for such a thing before, it follows, I suppose,”
she added with a mirthless little
laugh, “that I care this much for you or
for my experiment. Have you grasped
the whole situation?” she demanded, turning
her troubled eyes full on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My child, you have been very explicit,
I think I have quite grasped it. When
will you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>She gave a little start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was wondering,” she said at last,
“if this was final?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is final,” he said, “you know it is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know; it was rather paltry to
pretend I didn’t—oh!—”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked up at him with her face
held in both her hands. “Final? yes, so
it is. I am one section of a puzzle moved
by fate, you’re another. It is humiliating
when one comes to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will marry you when you like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The end of next month?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Won’t it interfere with the shooting?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had forgotten that—I don’t think I
shall mind—the end of July, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took her hands and kissed them, and
he thought as he got out into the street that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>he had felt them tremble. It was a
pleasant surprise, on which he felt inclined
to congratulate himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The knowledge had a quite other effect
on his betrothed. She smote her clenched
fists angrily together and scorned herself
for the feebleness of her extremities.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mean deceitful wretch,” she cried, “to
mislead that man, when I am only tired
and wanting my tea!”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There were some slight eruptions in the
domestic circle at Waring Park before it
was decided what form the wedding was
to take. As might be expected, Mr. and
Mrs. Waring in no way interfered, but
kept themselves carefully aloof from the
whole concern. But not so Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>On hearing of the engagement, he swooped
down on the paternal abode, all agog to
have his say in the arrangements. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was now a budding warrior, full of himself
and his profession, and horribly cocksure
on all subjects in heaven and on earth, a
good honest affectionate creature of conventions,
but with “a coarse thumb” which
he wielded in a promiscuous style, and
often planted sheer on the quick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre wanted a wedding that would have
astonished the neighbours, and that would
more than probably have been the death
of the two rarified beings who had borne
him, but Gwen, backed by Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes,
arranged things quite her own way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wedding was to be as quiet as
a wedding can be. Neither Strange nor
Gwen were rich in relations, which simplified
matters. Lady Mary must come, of
course, and the old Waring uncle, and one
or two creatures of an unobservant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>fossilized type, not worth mentioning,
besides a few of Strange’s belongings.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for friends, when Gwen began to cast
about in her mind on that subject, she
found that for her, putting aside Mr. and
Mrs. Fellowes, none existed. Of the girl
friends who usually flock in the wake of
a bride, Gwen hadn’t a vestige.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had gone to her room to straighten
her thoughts after a hot encounter with
Dacre, whose carnal mind still hankered
after a proper full-blown wedding, and had
been making itself objectionable in a bumptious
youthful style. She had lost her
cool scornful calm at last, and had given
him such a glance from her big eyes as
had quelled the British lion in him, and
had accompanied it with a lash of her
able tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Oh, you are anxious to amuse yourself
by importing the world and the flesh down
here—here! that they may sneer at two
people who, if they have brought children
into the world for pure purposes of investigation,
are at any rate too good to make
sport for your friends. You can get your
world and your flesh elsewhere, not here
at my expense.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never saw anyone just going to be
married like you before!” said Dacre, with
a dash of his old astonished terror at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably not, your experience not
being wide.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strange is a million times too good
for you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>To his astonishment he got no immediate
retort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stood up, getting rather white,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and went to the door. She stopped
in the shadow of the threshold, and a
gray shade fell on her face and made it
whiter, but a sunbeam caught her hair
and turned it to the orange-gold that Dacre
hated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fools speak the truth a great deal
oftener than they have any notion of,”
she said, “it is a pity that being thick-headed
themselves they can’t know how
it hurts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now she was in her room reflecting
gloomily on things in general.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never thought,” she said, “I never
thought that by any process of reasoning
I should be ashamed of the fact of having
no girl friends—I used rather to pique
myself on it, but upon my word I am
ashamed, I am degradingly, abjectly ashamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of it, it is one of the symptoms of my
disease.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went to the glass, and crossing her
arms on a little table near, she looked at
herself, laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would anyone think it to look at
me? I look so very sound and complete,
and yet I am rotten at the core, a sort
of Dead Sea apple. What a hackneyed
order of fruit to belong to, I am not
even original—ugh! I am inclined to
think if I were a downright bad woman,
who had sinned, sinned solidly,
and all for love—I wish to Heaven I
could get the feelings of one of them just
for five minutes, to understand this temptation
which to me is so utterly incomprehensible—Well,
I really think that Humphrey
would do better to marry a woman of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>sort than me. It has come to a pretty pass
when I—I, Gwen Waring, have taken to
envying that sort of person!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She raised her head, got to her feet,
and went down and played for an hour,
then she went out and walked, walked,
walked, till she hadn’t a leg to stand
on, and could no more think than she
could fly.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a week before his marriage,
Strange ran up to London for a couple of
days, but even to Gwen he did not specify
the nature of his business, which altogether
concerned Brydon’s launching in life.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he reached the studio, he found
things looking pretty bad. Like many a
better man, if his Art didn’t drive him
Brydon couldn’t drive his Art; besides, his
health was below par, there were days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and days when he couldn’t so much as
paint a potboiler, then he starved.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was learning Italian just now, to
solace himself. Strange perceived, however,
that the soft vowels hardly appealed
to an empty stomach. Brydon was a
haggard and distressful object, sitting with
Dante on the table before him, smoking
cheap tobacco, and with the ghastly beginning
of a sketch crying shame on him from
every corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Goodness, how outrageously jolly you
look! Is it engagement or ten thousand
a year?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’m all right, which is more than
you look! Taken to shag, I see—well,
I can stomach a lot, but not that. Would you
mind chucking that pipe somewhere where
it won’t smell, and try some of my stuff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>just to oblige me? Overheated Arab and
shag are the two stinks I draw the line
at. Hallo!” he remarked, looking at one
of the sketches.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am taking a holiday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was going on to lie a little—but
with a shrug he changed his course.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have to, as a matter of fact. I
can’t paint, I’ve lost the way—do you
ever forget the way to write?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do I? The deuce I do! We all do
at times, then we feel like throat-cutting
or ‘Rough on Rats.’ However, I came
on business. I have some spare cash and
I want to invest it, and on looking round I
have come to the conclusion you would
be rather a good thing to put some of it
into.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“I?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, even your beastliest daubs have
something in them that saves their souls.
One has to look more than once at everything
you do, even if it is only to swear
at it. You have capacity somewhere about
you, wherever you hide it—as for drawing,
you don’t know the beginnings of it!
But what’s that? You can learn, it’s a
mere question of swatting. If I had any
doubt of your success, I wouldn’t be here
to-day. I never on principle put a penny
into a rotten concern, and I am here to
make you a definite distinct offer, as
binding on you as on me. I will defray
your expenses in Paris for three years, I
will give you enough to learn under the
best men, and to live decently, not a
farthing more,—don’t speak yet!—”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Brydon had jumped up rather wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait till you hear all about it—your
conditions are pretty hard. In case you
should die during your apprenticeship—the
best of us are liable to that contingency—I
shall insist on you insuring your life
for an amount equivalent to that I lay
out on you. If you live (the best thing
you can do under the circumstances), you
shall pay me back principal and interest
in a given term of years, say fifteen,
after you begin to sell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon threw himself down into his
chair and buried his head in his hands,
a limited diet of bread and mustard
had taken the starch out of him. He
was soft, and his eyes were brimful of
tears, he was young too, and nearly burst
in his efforts to bolt them, then he lifted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>his head from his hands and began precipitately,</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have given me the chance of a
career, you put the world within reach
of me, you trust me down to the ground,
all in one breath. Look here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>For one minute he was about to throw
back the salvation waiting under his nose
with most laudable self-respect, but he
looked at Strange and his heart got soft
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d black your boots for you, why
shouldn’t I be dependent on you? I’ll
take your offer, and—and—and—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I told you the conditions, I shall stick
to them, we don’t thank one another or
get emotional in these transactions, I mean
to have my money back, principal and
interest, my full pound of flesh. I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>doing a trade with you—take it or leave
it, as you like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know I’d die for you?” cried
Brydon, in a burst of low-diet mawkishness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Die, before you’ve paid in a penny of
your premium! If we can come to terms
off-hand, I should like to finish up the
matter at once, and start for my lawyer’s.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon got up without a word, and began
to make himself decent with shaking hands.
At last he found safety in a wild burst of
gaiety and by the time he had his best
coat on, he was bubbling over with a
nervous gentle sort of fun peculiar to
his kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were going downstairs he
stopped, and remarked in a soft deprecatory
sort of way,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I say! I believe my heart’s next to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>gone. Three goes of rheumatic fever
leaves that part of a fellow not worth
mentioning. Won’t that make the premium
pretty stiff?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably, I never thought of that.
However, it’s you will have to pay the
piper, not I.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re an artist in conferring favours—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, for Heaven’s sake, stow that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wouldn’t take your offer, by Jove!
I wouldn’t, but that I mean to repay you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I’ve already taken good care of
that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The money isn’t everything,” said
Brydon impatiently, “there is such a thing
as being proud of a fellow you’ve made,
of valuing your own creation—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All that comes in the contract, the
sense of moral elevation it gives one to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>run a successful concern, even if it’s only
an artist, pleases the carnal mind. There
was only the choice between you and a
patent medicine, I’d have gone for that
but that I heard at the last moment that
peppermint was the active principle in its
manufacture—I draw the line at peppermint—and
you were the only alternative.
And look here, old man—But, good Lord!
See that child there? Which is more
human, the child’s face or the monkey’s
on the organ? Upon my word, the imp
scores off the beast only in the matter
of cheek pouch. Gru! how it hangs!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon shuddered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You always see the beastliest details!
Couldn’t you keep them to yourself! I
shall dream of that child for a week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And yet you devour Zola? I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>begun something, what was it? Oh,—if I
were you I should walk gingerly as soon
as you strike Paris pavement; there is
something in it that drives fellows mad.
London is a fool to it! It’s a bad investment
for any man, but it would spoil
your work for a twelvemonth, if it didn’t
give me my premium sooner than I want
it. That weak heart of yours, Charlie,
if you work the thing properly, should be
as good as a family chaplain to you, and
it isn’t every man that can boast of as
much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Talk of utilitarianism,” sighed Brydon,
“it is to be a struggle, then, between my
natural instincts and my game heart. I
wonder which will win?”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> Gwen was dressing for her wedding,
it never somehow struck her mother to
go to her room, and Gwen had herself
given an absolute command that no one
should ask her to do so. She made no
remark at all on the subject when she did
not come, but she insisted on going to the
church in the carriage with Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was useless to oppose her, she was like
adamant on this point, which set Dacre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>swearing like mad. She was white and
silent as they drove off. Mrs. Fellowes was
silent too, and rather whiter, but she daren’t
show any feeling; they were on the brink
of a general upheaval, and her whole
energy must be concentrated to ward it
off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen felt her situation with such
cruel intensity, that even to herself she
had to pretend to a total stony indifference,
but when they got to the gates
she sighed and stirred softly and put out
her hand with unaccustomed wistfulness
and laid it on Mrs. Fellowes. It was
cold and stiff. Mrs. Fellowes rubbed it
gently between hers and laid it lovingly
against her cheek, and kept in her tears,
she dared not speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God help her, God help her, and God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>help Humphrey!” she kept repeating to
herself in a sort of childish entreaty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen,” she said at last, “you must not
look like this when Humphrey sees you.
Gwen, my darling, you have nothing to
fear with such a man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think I fear him? I thought
you would have known better, it is myself
I fear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yourself is a bogie you have set up,
Gwen, Humphrey will soon demolish that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I felt sure of it. I wish I felt
sure of anything. Upon my word, Mrs.
Fellowes, upon my word, I wish from
the bottom of my soul I could say with
any decent show of honesty, God help us,
Humphrey and me! But God never felt
so unreal, such a mere bubble to please
fools, as He does at this minute—Don’t,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>don’t exclaim, or protest, or be shocked—not
to-day, my wedding day, and such a
brilliant match, too!” she added laughing.
“Ah, well! I won’t hurt you, we’ll leave
that part.—My father is to go through
the farce of bringing me up to the altar,
is he not?” she asked, thrusting all trace
of emotion from her face and sitting up
straight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you don’t keep a very sharp eye
on him he is sure to do something
quite unique. If one could only wind
him up and touch springs at intervals!
one can’t unfortunately, and I feel sure
I shall be made ridiculous. Your eye
must get off him now and again, so I suppose
I may as well accustom myself to
the thought,” she went on with a shrug,
“and resolve to swallow the whole hog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>without grimacing, but I do so loathe
being made to look like a fool. Are we
here? Oh, my flowers! The children
have them perhaps? Yes, look!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As she walked up the church, just
touching her father’s arm, with Mrs. Fellowes’
two little nieces in white gauze
and water lilies, looking like a pair of
lilies themselves for softness and cool
creaminess, trotting after her, her mother
from her chancel pew caught sight of her
for the first time.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a minute she looked dazed and
frightened, then suddenly with a broken
smothered cry, she leaned forward and
threw out both her hands to her daughter,
two big tears in her eyes, and her face
tremulous with a great joy that was pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes saw it, it was intensely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>pathetic to her and a revelation. She had
at last, at the end of all these years,
seen a glimpse of this small, golden-headed
creature’s motherhood—after all she was
really human! She hurried up, sat down
beside her, and gently brought her back
to herself. Then with one of Mrs.
Waring’s hands caught in hers, as if she
had been a child, she looked at Gwen,
and wondered how on earth any girl with
a stone for a heart could look as divine as
she did. She looked round the church, and
every man, woman, and child was worshipping
her in audible silence. There was
not a whisper, not a joke, not a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the cake was cut, Gwen
went away to dress. As she passed Mrs.
Fellowes she whispered,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Will you help me? I want to speak
to you.—Mary, Mrs. Fellowes will help me
to dress, and please don’t cry,” she said
wearily, “I shall see you often, and—really,
I have given you no very special
reason to cry for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She half laughed, then she stooped and
kissed the old woman’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have always been so good to me,
come and see me before I go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mary had disappeared, choking,
Gwen turned to the glass and began to
take off her bracelets.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit down and let me take off your
wreath,” said Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I had done as Mr. Fellowes
suggested,” said Gwen at last, playing
with a diamond dagger that Strange had
given her, “and looked through that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>marriage service; it is a degrading thing
to lie as I have done to-day. I might
have been any common-minded vulgar
woman perjuring myself for a settlement.
You see, I am marrying as a sort of
experiment!—Oh, don’t, you gave my hair
an awful pull!—Humphrey knows it, but
I didn’t realize that I should actually have
to swear to a lie—no experiment is worth
that. I have put myself in a false position,”
she continued, stirring irritably,
“from having told those miserable blatant
lies. I was never at a wedding in my
life in the church, I always managed to
escape that part, and I really never thought
of the words, ‘love, honour, and obey,’
in any solemn, binding, personal connection.
On the whole, it is a pity for women
not to have been reared on Bibles and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Prayer-books, it might keep them
from some pitfalls, and no doubt the
ordinary mother is useful too, in such
cases.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes’ heart quivered painfully,
and her hands trembled as she twisted up
a coil of Gwen’s hair that had come loose.
She had suspected the truth very early
in the day, but all through her short engagement
Gwen had kept both her and the
Rector at arm’s length.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I found out what I really was
in for,” went on Gwen, “it was too late
to draw back—no, it wasn’t!” she cried,
“the habit of lies is growing on me, but
then I was ashamed, too much of a
coward.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is very sad,” said Mrs. Fellowes
at last, “it is so sad, dear, that one can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>hardly speak of it. No woman has the
right to try experiments, to play pranks
with hearts and souls. You deserve—ah,
what a brute I am! I have no right
to scold you, my poor Gwen, you’ll have
to pay dearly enough for your play.
You will know some day what you
have done,” said she, laying her soft
warm cheek down on the girl’s head in
the caressing way she had when Gwen
was a child, “then you will suffer, ah,
child, how you will suffer! But it is
Humphrey one feels for now. Gwen, you
must not let him feel you are so far
from loving him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He knows. You don’t suppose I lied
to him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He knows in a way, but he doesn’t
realize the knowledge, nor does he quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>know the material he has to work on, or
how the twist came into the warp and
woof of it. Gwen, don’t let your horrid
truthfulness make you cruel, be patient,
dearest, be patient, this love won’t come
like a shock, it will steal in on you,
and I am perfectly convinced your first
impulse will be to kick it out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen gave a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes dropped the brooch with
which she was going to fasten Gwen’s collar,
went a few steps away, and looked
at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey knows precious little about
you,” she cried, with some natural irritation,
“he is dazed, small blame to
him! so am I, so is John, we are all
dazed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her eyes filled suddenly with tears.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“We all pour out our love on you,
and—and for what? Just for a cold
ghost of a thing, for mere hope—hope,
what good is that to any man? Now,
look here, Gwen, don’t let Humphrey
know this, naked truth though it be.
There is no lie in the matter, you can
love, darling, you can, ’tis only the
learning that is the trouble for you, but
I have a horrid hateful presentiment, in
spite of all I can say, that your most
objectionable direct methods will run you
into deplorable difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Truth is tangible, even if it is brutal,”
said Gwen, “but love—love—love, this
intangible vague horror, why should I be
persecuted with it, why should I realize
now that, vague as the thing is, it is
sacred, and a sort of crime of a very low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>order to be incapable of it? I got as far
as that in church to-day with all those
glaring faces on me, and Mr. Fellowes’
eyes—he has no right to look through
people like that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned away to hide the crimson
in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then this one-flesh business, this is
a horrid thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She squeezed her hands into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is maddening!” she cried, and
sprang up and stood looking out of the
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One flesh!” she murmured breathlessly,
“One flesh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently she shook herself, and with a
long sigh brought the calmness back into
her face, then she went and put her two
hands on Mrs. Fellowes’ shoulders and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>looked down on the sad face with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here!” she said, “advise every
girl you care about not to try experiments in
marriage, and to read the marriage service
with the man she is engaged to
standing opposite to her, before she dares
to quote from it in church before all the
rag-tag and bobtail of society. And now,
give me my hat and kiss me, you don’t
know how much a part of my life your
love for me is, even though it is fed on
hope only, and—I shall try to be honest
to myself without any flagrant brutality
to Humphrey,” she said laughing, “I
think that is all I can promise just yet.
Ah, what a lovely scheme of colour!”
she cried, looking at her superb figure,
in its dusty-amethyst gown with the flashes
of lemon-yellow in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Do you think my father and mother
are awake to the fact that I am married
to-day?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you had heard your mother’s cry
when she saw you go up the aisle, and
had seen her face—as long as I live I
shall never forget either!—you would have
no need to ask such a question,” said
Mrs. Fellowes, with gentle gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought she looked rather different
from usual, and I fancied my father’s arm
trembled when I held it. So—so!” she
said with a half-mocking smile as she
fastened the top button of her glove, “so
marriage is so solemn and sacred a subject
that it has actually touched the human
part of those two people! Ah, Mary,
here I am, ready for my new life—do
you like me? The outside is satisfactory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>is it not? It is quite pleasant to feel so
like a whited sepulchre!” she said to
Mrs. Fellowes as they went down the
stairs, “it excites me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> the two drove away on the first
stage of their experiment, Mr. and Mrs.
Waring, the Rector and Mrs. Fellowes,
Dacre and a few others stood watching
them from the great stone steps of the
hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes was reflecting with mixed
feelings on Gwen’s good-bye to her mother,
which by chance she had witnessed. The
girl had already, in the face of everyone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>bidden her a quiet and emotionless
farewell, but just at the last she had swept
round suddenly, as if she were driven, and
had caught the little dazed creature—a
deal too young to be her mother—in her
arms, and had given her an imperative
hug of the volcanic order. As it was a
first experience, no one could blame the
little woman from shrinking visibly from
it, and, when it was over, for escaping
with a sigh to the side of her husband,
and slipping her hand into his with the
air of one who has escaped a danger.
Gwen allowed one flash of angry pain to
shoot from her eyes, then she walked
grandly out of the house with her hand
quite properly on her father’s arm, which
Dacre took good care to have in readiness.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Dacre!” said Mrs. Fellowes, as soon
as they were well off, “we must get rid
of these people. I am sure we have all
done our duty by them, and your father
and mother have, very obviously, had
enough of them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am ready to swear that Admiral
Trowe has had a good sight too much of
the governor. He has been hammering into
him the life and blow-up of that gray rock
at Henty’s they are always grubbing at, for
a solid ten minutes. Now he’s on selection,
and the Admiral has murder in his eye—look!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, and your mother, see how tired
she looks! She is telling Mrs. Irvine the
most wonderful new facts about babies.
Mrs. Irvine has ten, two sets of twins
among them, and she is the champion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>mother of the parish. Dacre, you cover
one wing, I shall manœuvre the other,
there’s not a minute to lose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In next to no time they had cleared
the field, and Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes were
just about to say good-bye and to carry
Dacre off to dinner, when to their amazement,
after a hurried consultation, Mr. and Mrs.
Waring begged them to stay, and drew
them into the library, utterly ignoring the
furious Dacre, who betook himself, softly
swearing, to the stables, where he wandered
disconsolately, scathing the screws that
lumbered the stalls and thanking God lustily
that his stud was elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes were
closeted together in the library. While
the other two looked silently and questioningly
at one another Mrs. Fellowes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>telegraphed despairing signals to her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has been a most wearing day,”
said Mr. Waring at last, “I feared my
wife would break down under the strain.
No doubt you felt it too?” he went on
with his brows raised, looking concernedly
at his guests. “I thought, my dear,” and
he pressed her hand, “I thought, my dear,
that our daughter Gwen bore it admirably,
the girl appears to have much courage,
the courage of your race, my love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He beamed softly down on her, and
paused for an unconscionable time, then
suddenly he remembered himself and
started.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our daughter Gwen is a very beautiful
person,” he went on, musing aloud. “I do
not think I ever noticed the fact until lately,
until that night she went to some—h’m—party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>with Lady Mary. Dearest, do you
recollect?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perfectly,” said Mrs. Waring, getting
a shade paler, and with a troubled look in
her eyes, “you saw her, Mrs. Fellowes,”
she said with sudden eagerness, “that
night?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did indeed, Gwen’s beauty was a
shock to me. But I didn’t know—that
is, I thought you were busy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah yes, very busy, I remember, but
we came out to see Gwen, she was on
the stairs, and we got no farther than the
door, the lamplight shone on her and cast
soft strange lovely shadows on her white
silk—it was silk, was it not, Mrs. Fellowes?”—She
nodded. “And her arms
and neck were like—down—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Snow,” murmured her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“No, dear, they looked too warm for
that, and her face! We were, I think, a
little frightened at its beauty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gave a little shy laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We should have come out, but just
then I do not think I could have spoken.
My husband thought I was not very well
and he brought me back—Henry spoils me,
Mrs. Fellowes—but to-day I shall never
forget Gwen’s look, never!” and her small
face got still one shade whiter.</p>

<p class='c000'>She tried to say something but she
only made a little husky noise, she turned
to Mrs. Fellowes and tried again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know Gwen,” she said faintly, “do
you think she was happy to-day, as a bride
should be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes looked keenly at her and
turned to her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Mrs. Waring must lie down, she is
worn out,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made ready the sofa and drew the
trembling small creature down on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring yielded her up with a disturbed
and astonished gaze, and stood
aside contemplating events patiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Henry,” she said softly, after resting
silently for a minute, “ask Mrs. Fellowes
what we want to know—tell her our—our
fears.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He came over and laid his hand on her
sunny head, that time seemed to have
quite forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear friends,” he said solemnly,
“my wife and I are in some perplexity.
The fact is—h’m—we have never, so to
speak, known much of our daughter Gwen,
she is a difficult person to know. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>time to time we have attempted to gain
some nearer knowledge of her, but she—ahem—in
fact, did not seem inclined to
encourage our advances. From her very
babyhood,” he went on more fluently,
“the girl has interested us very keenly,
she has been quite a study to us, but I
regret to say we have never arrived at
any very definite conclusions about her,
we have never quite understood her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!” said Mrs. Waring, suddenly
bending towards Mrs. Fellowes, with a
look very like terror in her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course you more than I, dear,”
said Mr. Waring, “you have your woman’s
instincts to guide you, and they, as a rule,
are trustworthy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have never known Gwen,” said she,
with very unusual decision.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“What is your opinion on this matter?”
said Mr. Waring, turning to Mr. Fellowes,
“you know our daughter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all cruelly pathetic, his voice,
and his face, and his gesture, and the
strained hopeless look in his small wife’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen is not ready yet for complete
happiness,” said Mr. Fellowes; “when she
is, it will come to her in full measure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—she is a person of intelligence and
what is called grown-up,” said Mr. Waring
anxiously, “and very perfect in her development—outwardly,”
he added, a doubtful
look fleeting across his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, to look at, she is perfect, but does
it not strike you,” said Mrs. Fellowes slowly,
“that much of Gwen’s womanhood is still
elemental? Do you not think that some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of her senses are also still in that condition?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” murmured Mr. Waring, looking
sadly down on his wife, “Ah! I have
thought, I have feared this. I cannot see
in our daughter Gwen a complete creature,
but I thought, knowing so little of women
as I do, that I might be mistaken. Do
you hope for ultimate completeness in
our daughter?” he asked suddenly, watching
curiously for the answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rector’s superior knowledge of
Gwen had fixed him very uncomfortably
on a pedestal, there was no getting off
it just yet, he had to make the best of
the situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed I do, no half development
will content Gwen when she learns
her deficiencies, nor her husband either.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“These elements then may develop to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>ultimate greatness or wither and die—to
reappear, of course, in some form or other.
But to disappear from our knowledge
untimely! Ah! that would be sad waste.
We will hope it may not occur. Do you
happen to know if her husband looks on
our daughter as we do, in relation to her
ultimate possibilities of development, or if
he has chosen her for the thing she looks—a
most beautiful and finished young woman
of fair intelligence?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite sure that Strange loves
Gwen strongly and truly,” began Mr.
Fellowes evasively.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a difficult subject to thrash out
thoroughly with this wonderful pair, it
might be better to let it fade gradually
from their minds, and to aid them to glide
back into their own still waters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Yes, but on what grounds?” went
on Mr. Waring with strange persistence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you ever spoken to Strange
himself on the subject?” asked Mr. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahem, no. In fact, under like circumstances,”
he reddened and coughed a little,
“I should myself have resented any attempt
of such nature. No, I did not put any
questions to Strange. But will you not
favour us with an opinion, you, who
know our daughter so well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think that, in a measure, Strange
knows what he is about, and we are bound
to trust his judgment. It would be folly
to suppose that he sees the entire truth
clearly, he is under the usual conditions
of a man in love. Gwen dominates him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>as she does even us old married people,
hearts and brains will always fall before
our Gwen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the entire truth?” said Mrs.
Waring, pushing her hair back and sitting
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The truth as it strikes me,” said Mr.
Fellowes very gently, “is, that Gwen is
at present incapable of loving.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You refer—ahem, to that phase of
the emotion known as sexual love?” said
Mr. Waring hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Or of any other yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew it, we both knew it, but it
was hard to speak out,” murmured Mrs.
Waring sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She was in no way constrained,” said
Mr. Waring in a frightened way.</p>

<p class='c000'>His wife sat still with sad wide eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“It seems a reasonless thing in one in
Gwen’s position,” he went on with a fine
touch of pride, “to marry without love.
I know such things do happen now and
again with young portionless women—women
have a feline craving for soft
living and pretty things, but our daughter
Gwen—ah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought all this, I knew it,” said
Mrs. Waring quietly, “I wished so often
to ask Gwen definitely for the truth, but
I did not seem able to do so, I wish
now I had.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes put her hands tenderly
on her shoulders and made her lie down
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She will love, she will be happy!” she
whispered softly, “she is in good hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Too soon, too soon!” murmured the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>mother, “she should be in mine still. But
they never held her. She should be happy
now, now,” she cried with sudden passion,
her voice still in soft minors, “not in the
future! Why should she have to reach
her happiness and her love ‘through much
tribulation’? It should come by divine
right. She is so strong, she will suffer
strongly, she is so strong that when
passion comes to her it will tear her,
torture her, break her to pieces! Henry,
Henry,” she gasped, “we are to blame,
we have failed miserably! We never had
any right to have children. While we
have been worrying over the dry fossils
of the past we have allowed the living—the
young—to wither around us. Ah,
how sad it all is, how sad!” she sighed,
“how sad!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The Rector came and put his hand on
his wife’s shoulder softly. He well knew
how awful this too-late awakening of the
other woman’s motherhood was to her,
with her own so terribly, persistently
wide-awake and alive with the throbbing
of unsatisfied pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing further to be
said, nothing, altogether unsatisfactory
as everything was. Mr. Fellowes felt
this and said in his bright frank
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are all very tired, and you—”
he said, turning to his wife, “you are
frightfully washed out! And, good gracious!
Dacre is waiting all this time!”</p>

<p class='c000'>To her own intense amazement, Mrs.
Fellowes stooped down and gave Mrs.
Waring a kiss.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The other’s tremor went through her
like an electric shock and she did
not get over it for the rest of the
evening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> day after the wedding Dacre decided
to depart in rather indecent haste. The
situation was too much for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the morning he had been receiving
a succession of small shocks, but some time
after lunch he experienced an awful one.
He caught his mother’s eyes fixed on
him with such a dumb yearning as
would have upset a rhinoceros, not to
say Dacre, and he could have sworn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>to two tears that gathered in them
and were as suddenly dried up. He
blushed furiously and fled, in a terrible
access of shyness, to the Rectory, where
he astonished Mrs. Fellowes by the heat
of his countenance and his greedy consumption
of tea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious!” she thought, “is he
in love—Dacre?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took up her cup, and gulping
down her tea in rather an hysterical
way, she watched him over the edge of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The colour, and the stutter, and that
awful thirst, they are all deadly symptoms.
On the contrary, the amount
of cake he swallows goes against it.
What can it be anyway? Mercy! Can’t
he hurry? I feel worn out between
them all.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Presently Dacre recovered a little and
began to talk in a desultory way, saying
a vast number of things he didn’t
want to say, but on the whole lucidly
enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes pricked up her ears and
grew keen all over, she got for her pains
little direct information but, with a previous
experience of the family, enough to go on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Worse than lovers!” she thought
ruefully, “poor little woman! All the same,
I am not the least surprised he wants to
clear—he ought to stay though!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre, your mother will miss Gwen more
than any of us think, you have no idea how
upsetting a wedding is, you might come
in very useful just now. Won’t the
regiment survive if you stay down for a
few days?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Dacre wriggled on his seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes, I have to go back, it
is absolutely imperative.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed. “So it seems by the
look of you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at that big fellow!” she thought,
“who fears neither man, death, nor devil,
nor God much to speak of, routed by one
flash of feeling from an unexpected quarter.
The creatures can’t stand the unexpected
at all, they are intrinsically conventional!
If that fool had a glimmer of sense in him,
he would have given the poor little woman
a hug, and have let her have a comfortable
easy howl for once in her life. I suppose
she is doing problems with the old fossil
in the library instead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre felt his size frightfully, and began
to contrast it mentally with the Sevres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>cup in his hand. He set it down, and
towering huge above Mrs. Fellowes, delivered
himself of another solemn asseveration
as to the impossibility of staying
one day longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear boy, I am quite convinced,”
she said, “if you did, your country must
infallibly burst up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes, that isn’t fair!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No more it is! Sit down, Dacre, I
have to shout to make my voice reach
you up there, and yours comes down on
me like a thousand bricks. What do you
want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a sigh of relief and settled
down comfortably.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want you to go and see her,
and—oh, you know best then what to
do. Don’t you think—I don’t know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>but perhaps if you were to take her out
for a walk or something.—Oh, good-bye,
Mrs. Fellowes, and thanks, thanks, most
awfully!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes watched him swing along
down the drive, then pull up with a
jerk to speak to her husband who was
coming up, then swing off again out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor old Dacre! But why didn’t he
kiss her, the fool? I suppose he wasn’t
‘game’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She put some fresh tea into the pot
and set her kettle on the little spirit lamp
to boil up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has Dacre been making you a declaration
of unlawful love?” said the Rector
when he came in. “He had precisely
that air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Worse than that a thousand times. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>mother looked like crying, and was on the
point of breaking out into sudden and
condign maternal affection. Dacre fled
incontinently. He is going to make a precipitate
retreat to his regiment, and he
came to plant me in the breach. The
longer one lives, the less one thinks of the
courage of your sex.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Want of experience makes cowards of
us all. You couldn’t expect the fellow to
face the unknown!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s it, you are all tarred with the
same brush, you must have brutal sight to
steady your nerves. Now, we——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You! You, my love, have intuition.
Besides, there is a quotation that might
apply, ‘fools rush in—’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do drink your tea, and don’t try to
be funny, I feel awful.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“I feel rather off myself, I have just
been at the Park.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, oh! What were they at?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Waring was lost in some new speculation,
his wife was lost in a bad dream.
I suppose this late awakening of her nature
is good for her, but it seems cruel. It
hurts one to see her suffer in that still,
patient way of hers, and it will play the
deuce with Waring’s way of life if it goes
on. It wasn’t nature, of course, but that
absolute oneness of their life was a beautiful
thing to watch, and quite unique. I
suppose I ought to be glad that it has
received this check, but I’m not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you ought to be ashamed of
yourself for wanting to perpetuate such a
life—have you forgotten Gwen’s face?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall I ever forget it, Ruth? But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>anything absolutely unusual in a sober
married couple, and in a Midland parish
on a clay soil, the carnal mind will cling
to like any burr. Let us put the moralities
aside for a moment and consider the
subject with the pagan mind. What would
outside life be to you or to me in these
smug levels, except for that delicious pair
of maniacs? We both know how stodgy
undiluted duty grows, how one’s feet stick
and stumble in it, faithfully as one tries
to keep one’s eyes on the ‘everlasting
hills’; how dreary and hopeless work often
seems in scattered districts, with neither
abject poverty nor active crime to fight
against, to raise and keep alive in one
the inspiring battle greed. But to be
obliged to face a level life daily; to spend
one’s soul in trying to raise sodden dough;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to galvanize half-dead things, heavy, dull,
sullen hearts, neither hot nor cold, desiring
neither good nor evil, knowing neither
tears nor laughter, but slogging on to the
grave in dreadful patience! And, in spite of
exceptions, this is the life of dozens of
country parsons, only we hold our tongues
about it, or else we hunt and fatten ourselves,
or we have big families to blunt
our feelings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“John, what’s wrong?” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stroked her hair softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing except myself, I suppose.
You know I was at the Low Church
Meeting yesterday, and the fellows tried
me, some of them are so intense as
regards food—that isn’t so indecent as
haste, however. In the hurry to gobble
his brown soup that he might have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>go at the white, Lang nearly choked
himself. Then it went against one to
see how they swallowed syrupy port,
one could feel the saccharine sediment
on one’s tongue, it showed somehow a
defective development. Then when gossip,
chiefly concerning the gone-astray young
women of the neighbourhood set in, they
grew so keen on their subject, that three
of them fairly spluttered. When this course
was removed and religion brought on, one
seemed to get a blow at every turn, the
meat and the drink had got into our souls
and it came out in our speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks well for me, little woman,
me, a middle-aged country parson,
with a fat parish, and reputed sane;
but I would give it all, and my eyes
into the bargain, to be in the thick of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the turmoil—I don’t care a rap where,
London holds no talisman for me any
more than any other big centre—where
men teem and life lives, for it seems even
better to live in pain than to doze in
apathy. Ah! if only my brutal health
would have stood it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor John, how the old sore will
break out!” she said tenderly, with a
short, dry little sob, “and I too, I would
give it all, and my eyes to boot, if I had
just one little child.—And Mrs. Waring,
up there in her fine house, would give it
all if she could only grasp her lost motherhood.
Two old sores and a new!</p>

<p class='c000'>“After all,” she added, “when all’s said
and done, we are no worse off than our
neighbours. None of us, it seems to
me, get any more than the rags and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>fragments of their hearts’ desires, and
yet we all manage to make life jolly on
them. We do, John,” she said, with a gay
little laugh.—It was wonderful how she
managed it with her heart quivering.—“Look
in my face and say we do!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked in her face, and he kissed her.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> Strange set out on his honeymoon,
it was with a distinct project simmering
in his brain. He meditated a good three
months’ loiter through the byways of the
Tyrol, on into Switzerland, and then home
through the towns of the Netherlands,
and all by routes best known to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It becomes, however, a moral impossibility
for a man to loiter with any comfort by
the side of a new-made wife, into whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>very bones and marrow the spirit of unrest
has crept, and so, by intangible gradations
the loiter had developed into a tumultuous
forging on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen seemed possessed by a very dignified
and quite calm-seeming devil; he was
a gentlemanly creature and made no untoward
fuss or excitement, but movement
he must have, he dared not rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of herself, Gwen found
growing in her from the very day of
her marriage, a craving, full of subdued
fierceness, to be in the very middle of
the hurly-burly, no matter whether it
raged in a fashionable hotel, or, in the
market-place of a country town. She
had, besides, other uncomfortable ways.
In valleys, where the sun shone and
the wind rested, and where ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>mortals were bathed in a soft entrancement
of delight, she seemed to lose half
her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the contrary, she lived, her voice
regained its timbre, her eyes shone, her
mouth laughed, her very hair sparkled
with vitality, as soon as ever she got high
on a mountain—the bleaker and harsher
the better.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day they had climbed to the top
of the D’Auburg, a dour-looking mountain
in the Tyrol generally avoided of tourists,
but for some reason Gwen took it into
her head to ascend it.</p>

<p class='c000'>She now sat glowing and tingling with
radiant health, leaning up against a rock
that sheltered her from the blast that was
screeching across the ledge of the mountain.
She looked as cool, and as beautiful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>unruffled, as if she had just dropped from
the clouds, instead of climbing up to them
by a most villainous path. There was
always a sort of exotic splendour about
her, and yet she never seemed out of
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you never tired?” said her husband,
as he was pouring some wine into a little
silver cup.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never! I don’t remember ever once
having been tired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Looked at from the carnal mind of a
chaperon, that was rather a nuisance,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was; Lady Mary suffered a good
deal from it. I used to try to accommodate
myself to her in this matter and to look
tired, but I never could manage it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have another sandwich?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>She went on in a reflective way as she
ate it,</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a wretched thing generally, for a
woman to be absolutely untireable. A very
strong woman is docked of half the privileges
of her sex. If you notice the stock
devoted husband, he has always a sickly
creature of a wife to devote himself to—or
one that poses as sickly—or if her body
isn’t sickly, her brain is. You hardly ever
find a woman quite sound in wind and
limb and intellect, with an absolutely unselfish
husband, ready to think all things
for her, and to dance attendance on her to
all eternity. Helplessness is such supreme
flattery. I tell you, the modern man
doesn’t like intellect any more than his
fathers before him did, if it comes home
too much to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“No! Sickliness and softness of brain
don’t, however, appeal equally to all
men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose not; but the things they
carry in their train do. The parasitical,
gracious, leaning ways, the touch of pathos
and pleading,—those are the things I should
look for if I were a man, they charm me
infinitely. Then that lovely craving for
sympathy, and that delicious feeling of
insecurity they float in, which makes the
touch of strong hands a Heaven-sent
boon to them—those women, you see, strew
incense in your path and they get it back
in service. When one hears of a devoted
couple and is called on to admire with
bated breath, I never can till I have dug
out the reason of this devotion. I hate
sticking up people on pinnacles, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>having to knock them down like a pair of
nine-pins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hero worship isn’t your tap evidently,
but if one makes a principle of never
smelling a flower or eating fruit until one
has ascertained the manure used in its
growth, one gets put off a lot. By the
way, I haven’t noticed any marked symptoms
of mental or physical decay in you, and
yet, God knows and can possibly score
up the number of your lovers—they
certainly were beyond all human computation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She flashed a quick untranslatable look
at him and smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My lovers? They weren’t lovers at
all, they were explorers, experimental
philosophers. They had the same strong
yearning for me that a botanist has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>for a blue chrysanthemum or a yellow
aster. If a man could succeed in getting
this thing he would go mad over it and
put it in the best house in his grounds
for all his neighbours and friends to admire,
but do you think he would love it like
an ordinary sweet red rose that he can
gather, and smell, and caress, and bury
his nose in, and wear near his heart?
Not he!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think one of these men
ever wanted to touch me,” she went
on calmly, taking little sips of wine, “or
to ruffle the hair round my forehead
which is their invariable habit in novels,
or to lay his hand on my bare shoulder—they
do that, too, I have read—or to clasp
me to his breast, the climax to these
pretty little customs of theirs? Goodness!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>And imagine my feelings if one had! But
they didn’t even want to; and yet they
were my slaves, to do with precisely as
I liked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I was in the thick of it I
thought I could not live without all this,
yet it was disappointing on the whole,
I believe. I remember wishing now and
then that I could flirt like other girls,
and make men make palpable fools of
themselves for my sake. It looks such a
very delightful pastime! I have seen plain
girls look positively quite beautiful when
engaged in it. The under-current of heaps
of girls lives, upon which it seems to
me all the rest is built up, is a sort
of simmering, unconfessed, vague longing
for the sensation of being ‘caught and
kissed’, like the little brown maid in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>old rhyme; not in a general vulgar
way, but in a well-bred particular way.
It is a quite incomprehensible sensation
to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably. It’s natural all the same,”
he said looking at her eyes which regarded
him curiously, “and Nature is such a
vindictive grasping beast it is as well not
to run counter to her, or she will have limb
for limb.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder what limb of mine she will
want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh you, she’ll trip you up in your
own coils somehow! Fill you with an
overpowering desire to be ‘caught and
kissed’,” he said with a short laugh, “and
have no one handy to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, then she must make me over
again!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>She stood up and looked down over the
gloomy valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it to be natural, I wonder?
I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Time will tell you all about it. Now,
you want to be down over that precipice?
Well, anyway, I am glad you are warranted
sound. Come on, my yellow aster!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were past the precipice, far
down the other side when Gwen spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey,” she said, with a stronger
trace of emotion in her voice than he had
ever detected there before, “upon my
word, I often wish for your sake I was
just a good common frowsy red cabbage-rose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, do you?—Well, ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Zeit bringt
Rosen!</span></i>’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>About</span> a week later they arrived in
Paris. Gwen had never been there before,
and her curiosity to see everything was
insatiable and unresting.</p>

<p class='c000'>She often seemed to herself as if she
were caught in the whirl of a mad intoxicating
race with fate; it was glorious; it
stimulated her like a draught of wine; it
filled her veins with fire; it was as if
the spirit of the world had got into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>her spirit and shot streams of the strength
of immortality through all her being.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was as a god to herself, and fate
was as a thing of naught. This was in
her times of exaltation however; but even
in these early days there came moments
of reaction in their due season. Fortunately
she knew the symptoms of their approach,
and could hide herself away from her
husband’s eyes. Her room could tell
strange tales whenever Gwen shut herself
in and threw up the sponge till the
next round.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there came shame into that proud
face, fear into those fearless eyes, a stoop
into those stoopless shoulders. She neither
ranted nor raved, she dared not; if she
had once raised her voice, she knew
quite well she must shriek, and howl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>forth the terror and disgust and dismay
with which the possible ending to this
race with fate filled her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes she would pull off her
shoes and stockings, and go barefooted
to and fro the length of the long polished
floor with its strips of Eastern carpet—the
cool slippery surface soothing the fever
of her flying feet. Invariably she would
pull off her guard and wedding-ring and
lay them with curious gentle wistfulness
down on the table. Once when she did
this, she drew a deep breath, threw out
her arms and laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am free, free!” she cried, “my
body is my own again, and my soul, and
my brain! I am myself again, Gwen
Waring, a self-respecting creature, with no
man’s brand on me—”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>In a few minutes she came back and
looked at the golden bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the use of lying?” she said,
“that mends nothing, and only degrades
me. I am not free; whatever happens,
whatever could possibly happen, I shall
never any more be what I was! Good
God! And yet women take marriage as
they do a box at the Opera!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not in the strong nature
of her, wholesome what there was of it
awake, to lose courage often, and her
powers of recuperation were superb. Half
an hour after she was striding wildly
through the room, she came down as
unruffled and more untranslatable than
ever, to propose some expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange looked at his watch. “Too late
for that, suppose we go and see Brydon?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Oh, yes, let us go,” she said
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her, and knew all
about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a minute he felt an overmastering
desire to shake her, and make her
eyes speak plain English, he was getting
tired of their hieroglyphics. He was buttoning
her glove at the time and involuntarily
he gave the button a cross twist
and twitched it out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, hang it, is the glove rotten or
are my methods? Will it matter?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, not at all, my sleeve will cover it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a diabolical lottery altogether,
and the soul of the man groaned within
him. It was even worse than he had
anticipated in the first hot glamour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>love. He freely confessed this, but he had
sworn to himself, in his foolish raptures,
that he would face hell for the girl,
and he was not the man to eat his
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>They walked to Brydon’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen took a great delight in going in
and out among the streets, and a shamefaced
pleasure in listening to her husband’s
stories of every twist and turning
in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no one like him for a
companion!” she often confessed to herself
angrily, “no one I know that comes
near him. What made me marry him,
what? Even this part of him I can’t
accept and enjoy without disgust and
self-loathing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At last they got to the little street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that Brydon lived in, and climbed to the
fourth flat of a tall house.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Brydon saw Strange he reddened
with delight, but when he was presented
to Gwen, he paled suddenly and his
eyes fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You could have knocked me down
with a feather!” he explained afterwards,
to his chosen comrade.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a superb compliment to her,
and her husband laughed as he saw
it. And then a queer wonder took hold
of him as to the sort of ending this good
humoured half-impersonal pride he took
in her conquests would have, then this
evolved another wonder which dealt
with the birth of a strong woman’s passion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange pulled himself up and thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>this out of his mind with a rough
shove.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the whole, what’s the result so
far, Charlie?” he asked, when that young
man had established his wife in a big cane
chair, softening the light from one side
and strengthening it from another in a
lingering, absorbed way, as with half-closed
eyes he furtively drank in the fulness of
her beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question stripped the glamour from
him at a rush, he flopped limply down
on to a seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If only you hadn’t asked that question
for three more months, but now, now,
it is cruel! Just imagine a fellow, free
all his life to ride his own nag, a sorry
jade it might be, but anyway fit enough
for him, and his own; just fancy him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>strapped on to a small donkey belonging
to another fellow, that it would be more
than his life was worth to prod into a
gallop, and to have to peg along on this
beast week in, week out, along the same
old road! Oh Lord, the grind, it’s awful,
awful, digging one’s heels into that confounded
ass—Oh!—”</p>

<p class='c000'>He jumped up with a guilty start.
“Lady Strange, I beg your pardon, I
forget what ladies are like, and Strange
is such a comfortable fellow to growl to,
bad language slips out before one can
catch it, at the very sight of him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t apologize to me, especially if
my husband is the cause of your offence,”
said Gwen kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had a fancy to be kind to
this boy, if she had confessed it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>herself, it was with a distinct view of
getting to know a side of her husband,
that Brydon knew all about and she
nothing. She was making a study of
him in spite of herself, and liked to collect
evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meantime Strange had been looking
carefully through some of Brydon’s sketches,
scattered everywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll draw as well as you colour,
old man, and that is more than I ever
expected of you. What does Legrun say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He says he’ll say nothing until I have
unlearned every cursed mannerism I have
picked up in England, that den of bad
taste. Then ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être</span></i>—who knows?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the fellow rages just as much against
his own rapid methods, as he does against
those we’ve been born and bred in. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>dare we think to get an effect with a
few strokes like he does, he, who has
worked, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parbleu!</span></i> who has sweated, who
has prayed, who has blasphemed, who
has torn the heart out of his body
to arrive at this ease, this divine confidence—‘the
head of us should be
punched!’ he is great in English. We must
take twenty strokes to one of his; we
must do with pain, with tears, what is
but ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">delices</span></i>’ to him—details—we must
know them as the ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</span></i>’ knows them,
before we venture to omit or even to
suggest one! Then he ups and splutters
out some delicious blasphemy on some
unwary youth’s head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at me, the ghost of a creature,
stalking mournfully on eggs, with furtive
fear in all my lineaments. And this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>an artist’s training! Good Lord, when I
remember how I sat in that garret in
Bland Street and thought of fame and
myself in a new suit, dancing a war-dance
before my masterpiece on the line, with
duchesses squabbling for the first shake
of my hand!—Lady Strange, I am going
to make some tea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you would,” said Gwen laughing,
“we walked, and I am so thirsty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hu!” said Brydon, examining his milk-jug
when he had filled his kettle and
set it on the little charcoal stove, “every
drop gone! I won’t be two minutes. The
old lady on the first flat and I are affinities
to a certain extent; in return for sundry
packets of English tea, she keeps me in
milk at odd times. Strange, will you
shepherd the kettle?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“I wonder if his cups are clean?” said
Strange rummaging them out of a cupboard
over the stove, “look, an inch thick with
dust, and the handles! That fellow moons
too much to be very cleanly. Look at the
tea-cloth, Lord! Have you a clean handkerchief,
Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s brows contracted slightly. She
was a dainty person and unpractical, and
teacups in connection with handkerchiefs
gave her an uncomfortable feeling of
impropriety.</p>

<p class='c000'>She gave him a handkerchief however,
with a small gasp of disgust, and watched
his doings with a faint, half-scornful
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How particular you are!” she said,
“I had no idea you could trouble yourself
about such things.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“I can’t stand dirt in man or beast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you stand travelling—in
Algeria, for example?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! there—there were compensations,
the game was worth the candle, and if
civilization has produced nothing better—give
the devil his due—it has produced
clean skins and clean eating. I fancy I
was originally designed for an inspector
of nuisances,” he continued, running Gwen’s
lovely morsel of cambric on the end of a
pointed stick in and out the handle of
a cup.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen noticed with some wonder the
curiously delicate way in which he did
it, “The thing would have smashed long
ago in any other man’s hand,” she thought.
“He treats women like that, he is very
gentle, but he is the master, he holds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>them in his hand and does as he likes
with them. And I have no doubt whatever,
that there are at this minute hundreds
of women who would like it. Why doesn’t
that handle break and cut him—there is
no legal bond between them?” This struck
her grim sense of humour, and she had
to bite her lips to keep in a wild
laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, as a nuisance man I should have
been a success,” he went on, “whereas, as
a British landowner!” he gave an expressive
shrug. “Gwen, how do you think
you’ll stand a flat clay country, overrun
with woolly-brained squires and their
dames and daughters?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a horrid thought. Gwen gave a
swift little turn to put it away from her;
her dress caught in a stretched canvas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>put up face inwards against the wall,
and brought it down with a muffled
crash.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange came forward to help her put it
up, and, with a hand of each of them on
it, they paused suddenly and started, and
with a quick turn of his hand Strange
set it this time face outwards in its place,
and looked into it with eager excitement,
while Gwen’s face grew cold and still,
with a touch of sternness on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they were looking, the door burst
open and Brydon came in with the
milk and a soft paper parcel—looking like
cakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strange, how did you find it?” he
cried, “I never meant you to see it.
Lady Strange, it is only a sketch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I beg your pardon,” she said, “my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>dress caught in it and knocked it down,
and as we raised it we saw the face, then,
I suppose, curiosity did the rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When did you see my wife, Brydon?”
said Strange, still absorbed in the picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In church, the day she was married.
I know I should have been in Paris, but
I wanted to make this sketch. I want,
when I know well enough how to do it,”
he said, turning to her humbly, “to make
a picture of you, Lady Strange, and to
give it to Strange, and this is just the
idea for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure my husband must appreciate
your kindness,” she said half absently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps she might have put a little more
warmth into her voice if she had seen
the fallen face of the boy as he turned
to look to his kettle. She had, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>already more to occupy her than she
wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sketch was a stroke of genius. It
was a gracious, graceful girl, standing
before the altar in her shimmering marriage
robes, in actual flesh and blood, the great
soul of a woman shining out from the
violet eyes; the tender strength of the
mouth, the resolute pose of the rounded
chin, the russet gold of the hair—the
whole lived and thought. One held one’s
breath to catch the regular soft rhythm of
hers, the very hand held out for its ring
was palpitating with life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naturally, the whole thing would have
filled the soul of a dilettante with unutterable
disgust, being as glaringly full of
faults of detail as it well could be, but
an artist with half an eye in his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>would have put all these by in a place
by themselves to be dealt with later, and
would have gone mad over the truth that
remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the girl’s figure alone that made
the picture; the man she stood before, was
a mere blur of an idea, as were all the
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange’s eyes, as he watched the
woman, were brimful of a terrible joy, and
of a more terrible sadness.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Gwen, she fell to criticizing the
details in a way that made Brydon’s flesh
creep on his bones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is not the original sketch,” she
said suddenly, stopping short in a sweeping
criticism, “I wish you would show us that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very bad, you would like it still
less than you do this.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“I might like it less as a picture, but,
as a likeness, more, perhaps. Do show it
to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The mere suspicion of entreaty she
threw into her voice had never yet
been rejected by any man, and soft-hearted
Brydon was not going to be the first to
run counter to her inclinations, so altogether
against his will he pulled the
sketch, about half the size of the other
one, out from among a number of others,
and put it in a good light where she
could examine it at her ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” she said, “yes, that’s me,
myself! What induced you to idealize?
It was unjust towards me and dishonest
to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was neither, it was prophetic,” said
Strange in a low voice only audible to her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>She glanced at him for a second with
curling scornful lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it impossible then to make a
decent picture of me as I look now?”
she asked with a laugh, turning to Brydon,
who was blushing furiously and wishing
he could swallow himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No fellow living could do justice to
you,” he blurted out painfully, “however
you may look! but I was trying to paint
a bride, and there in that first study you
didn’t look just like one—from my own
confounded fault, no doubt, so I tried the
other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have certainly succeeded in
producing your bride,” she remarked
with a curious, absent smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>To give her her due, she did not know
how cruel her own pain made her. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>husband did, however; he winced as he
put the two sketches side by side to
compare them. He had the delicate
sensitive respect of most strong men for
feelings and other frail nervous things of
that sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen came and stood beside her husband,
and looked from one to the other
of the sketches.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now in this first one,” she said, “the
girl looks as if she were pre-ordained to
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> of bride; in this other one, as you
observe, she does <em>not</em>, but she is me.
I am so sorry to disillusion you of your
idea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have not,” said Brydon softly,
“only showed her many-sidedness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can get my wedding dress over,”
said Gwen, with a touch of malice about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>her mouth, “shall I, and give you a few
sittings in the character of bride?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, thank you, Lady Strange,” said
the boy, with admirable coolness, “I shall
stick to the ideal for my picture, I will
work hard on it. And when it is finished,
will you have it, Strange?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will I? The deuce I will! It would
be a magnificent present without another
stroke of work in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you call it, Humphrey?”
asked his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall call it ‘The Incognita’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Brydon, tea is getting cold all
this time, and I am so thirsty,” she said
with serene imperiousness, turning from
the sketches and going over to the little
table. “I hope you are as good at making
tea as you are at making brides,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>went on mockingly. “Sugar? Yes, please,
two lumps, and—galette? How delicious!
I do like French cake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lady Strange, you said you would sit
to me as a bride, did you mean it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did,” she said amusedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ungainly-looking boy with his great
saving clauses of eyes and his queer red
blushes and open admiration of herself,
gave her a sensation of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you sit just once in that dress—or
any other you like? You don’t know
how good of you it would be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it such a boon then when I require
such an amount of idealization?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lady Strange!” he murmured reproachfully,
with ludicrous woe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, well, then, I will sit for you—where—here?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Oh, not here! Did you think I would
have the cheek to ask you to climb these
steps to sit for me? Anywhere you arrange
for me to come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then come to our hotel, but I know
my husband intends to ask you to dine
with us to-day so we can then settle the
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you more than awfully!” he
cried with most unaffected fervour, “it’s
such a boon for a fellow like me to get
a lady; we can get more or less colour
and lovely flesh, you know, to paint
from in the cheap models, but then they
are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisette</span></i> to the very marrow. Besides,
it is not safe with Legrun even to
experiment on them. We must learn to
draw before we go about libelling even
models, he says, ‘Poor devils, they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>enough to put up without that!’ So
you can see what an inestimable benefit
you are bestowing on me. Strange, do
you notice my walls? Not a rag to break
the monotony.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do; I thought the sternness of Art
had come on you prematurely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, but Legrun did. I brought all the
old rags from the old shop and renewed
the stock here, and those four walls were
one delicate glimmer of colour, when, as
Satan himself arranged it, who should
come shambling and blaspheming up the
stairs one blessed Sabbath day but Legrun,
who insists upon having our addresses. I
thought he’d have a fit when he sat
down gasping and glaring at the walls.
‘My good lad,’ he roared at last, ‘how
old are you?’ ‘Nineteen,’ says I, shaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>like a jelly fish. ‘I thought you were
nine,’ he yelled, ‘and making a doll’s
house; clean down that filth, clean it from
the decent lime-washed walls that never
injured you, and remember—remember,
boy, that Art is serious, severe, stern,
grave, terrible,’ he shrieked, waving his
arms like a maniac, and spitting horribly,
‘it will stand no tricks, no mockings,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parbleu</span></i>! Rags!—Filth!—with the disease
shock full in them! Gur! Guz! Hu! Never
no more let me see such sights!’ and he
raged down the stairs into the street,
spitting, and scraping his throat,—he
lives in an awful funk of infection,—and
so I had to strip off my rags
and leave the walls to their native
nakedness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can have your revenge when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>you set up on your own account. Gwen,
it is nearly six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, we must go. We’ll see you at
dinner, Mr. Brydon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you walk or drive, Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will drive,” she said, and there was
a dull, tired tone in her voice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Gwen</span> was in an unusual humour this
afternoon. She was silent until they got
into the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</span></i>, but directly it moved she
began to talk in a swift even way peculiarly
her own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything she said had the calm
cold brilliancy of steel about it, and she
advanced the most dangerously heterodox
opinions in a most unimpassioned and
frozen style.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Strange shrugged his shoulders with
grim good humour as she went on. He
admired her splendid insolence, as any
man would have done; all the same, he
felt a half frantic longing for that
picture-bride and an ever-increasing wonder
as to how any woman cast in
the same mould, eye for eye, mouth
for mouth, dimple for dimple, curve for
curve, could so atrociously belie her
nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Gwen veered round and turned
the conversation into a personal and
analytical channel. She had never done
it before, except in her one brief allusion
to the yellow aster.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That boy of yours is a genius,
Humphrey, your swan is no goose,” said
she, “but, tell me, did I look in the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>least like that woman, the day you married
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her face of fine scorn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not in the least, except in the
matter of form, and colour, and pose.
These are you in tangible flesh and
blood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did you mean by your ‘prophetic’?”
she demanded, casting pink shadows over
her face as she moved the red silk blind
slowly to and fro.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The possibility of your being as she is
one day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The blind moved a little faster and
her hand held it tighter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I put it to you as a reasonable
man—do you believe in that possibility?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As a reasonable man, I do,” said he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>watching the pink shadows playing in her
dimples.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—? And how is this to come to
pass?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, there you have me!” he said, “I
don’t know—possibly God may, or the
modern monster, Evolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Through what processes, I should very
much like to know?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So should I, but I don’t, you see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’d feel better if her face flushed
like other women’s,” he thought; “it must
be ghastly to have to consume all one’s
own smoke like that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked out of the window, laughing
softly to herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look super-humanly cool,” she said,
“but this minute your pride is all agog
to knead and mould me into that bridal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>creature. It would be a triumph of Art
assuredly, and to your credit. I wish
you might have the kudos of it—why
can’t you—why can’t I help you to, for
the life of me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>There came a rush of calm restrained
vehemence into her cold tones that brought
them to a sort of white heat. “Why
am I not mouldable—or like other
women?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My good child, you could hardly
expect that from the daughter of your
father and mother—you are unreasonable!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, you are right, I had forgotten
them,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is abominable we should be such
puppets, not only present chances to
play fast and loose with us, but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>have to dance to the tune of old,
ignorant, half-daft ones, that should go
and rot in the grave of old failures! Why
should they stay and torment us? We
have enough of their kind to deal with
on our own account. Have you ever read
the Bible?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have I ever read the Bible! Do I not
know every inch of Syria, and every
second inch of Egypt? Yes, I have read the
Book, and on its native soil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps that may suit it, I don’t
think ours does. There was one thing,
however, I read in it, that took hold of
me; you may know it—‘God’s ways
are past finding out,’—this seems to me to
contain a whole philosophy, capable of
universal application, and reaching to the
present time.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“You are going too fast, my good Gwen;
isn’t that rather the philosophy of
ignorance? You are arguing from a point
you rarely affect—from the point of view
of Jewish theology with its strong, and
primitive, and mystery-loving methods.
God’s ways, after all, if we choose to dig
into them are no denser, and are just on
the same line as Nature’s. She permits
no cause without an effect, or she will
very well know the reason why.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wasn’t arguing from any point of
view, Jewish or otherwise, I was just
applying a theological axiom personally,
thinking of parents and other chances.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, that’s an idle subject, isn’t it?
By the way, you have a sneaking regard
yourself for that bridal creature—you
admire the woman, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Admire her! Yes, as a woman, of
course I do. Why, she is—superb! With
that mature strong tenderness in every
line of her, and that divine protecting
patient air of hers—that woman might be
a mother of nations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange started and his mouth twitched
suddenly, the blood stopped in his veins and
red and blue stars swam before his eyes.
Gwen went on unheeding, in her passionless
tones—</p>

<p class='c000'>“That woman is not, however, me. I
am a beautiful girl—that, and no more—I
contain nothing, I assure you, nothing
that could be moulded into that woman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You contain everything,” said her
husband slowly, “only the deuce of the
matter is, that none of us know where to
find it!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“No, nor ever will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She leant forward so that her breath
touched his cheek. “Humphrey, I wish
you had never seen that picture! This
necessity for idealization is an insult to
me and to yourself—you should have
had more insight from the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My good child,” he said laughing
softly, “I thought the experiment was an
avowed fact.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She drew in her lips sharply, and was
silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she spoke again her voice was
rather hoarse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have often tried to imagine the
things that go to a murder, and I really
do think I understand the impulse now.
I shall never altogether hate a murderer
again. I am glad I know; one feels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>better—more liberal, for every new sensation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And, after all, it was supremely
silly,” she went on, “the experiment <em>is</em>
two-sided, but you have no idea how
infinitely brutal the bald fact sounded.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bald facts mostly do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—there is reason even in experiments,
and remember, once for all, I am
not a dramatic creature given to sudden
new developments, I am no emporium for
the creation of fresh sensations; here I am,
finished and complete.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Finished and complete!’ Was ever
conceit like unto hers! My good girl,
you are neither.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She threw up her head.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Well, here I am then, unfinished and
incomplete.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but Nature invariably finishes
her work if it’s worth the tools.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Like Providence shapes our ends,”
she sneered with modulated savageness.
“Ah, this marriage truly is an experiment!
Look at those two at the window—that
girl and that man, that stunted creature
there! Perhaps he’s an artist. She has
a measly look and the man’s nose is
awful! They are not a scrap like Browning’s
artist and the girl, and yet, I fancy, they
think themselves in love with one another—tell
the man to stop for a minute!—here,
here, at this house—there, do you see the
idiotic simpers! Ah, yes, that’s love!
And the two will marry, no doubt, on next
Shrove Tuesday, but it won’t be an experiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>I don’t think either of the pair
looks as if he or she went in for observing
new phases.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ll have enough to do to keep
the wolf from the door. Perhaps in time,
instead of observing new phases they’ll
punch one another’s heads if they must
have fresh sensations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that the usual and orthodox end
to being in love—punching the head physically
or morally, according to the rank of
the lovers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, the methods vary according to
the quality of the love. Have you had
enough, shall we drive on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it’s worth its salt, of course there’s
no end.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One even continuous stream into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>ocean of—Nothingness! How appallingly
trite and stale—nothing fresh, nothing
new!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The state has a quite peculiar freshness
and newness of its own, I am told, which
is perennial—and here we are at the
door.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Gwen</span> dropped quite easily into the ways
of her new home, she could generally
adapt herself to mere physical conditions,
her unnatural unrest and craving for excitement,
in the first few weeks of her
married life, were, of course, the symptoms
of an abnormal mental condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>So when she had to face the inevitable,
and to stay her albatross-flight and
betake herself to the domestic roost she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>did it gracefully enough, and if her
wings did strain and stretch themselves
now and again, till they often came near
snapping, and would pull and tug at her
as if they wanted to drag the heart out
of her body, no one but herself—and one
other, who guessed very near to the
truth—was any the wiser.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was perhaps the unconfessed
humdrumness of life when her flight had
ceased, that set her off on her new track—that,
and her sense of justice, which
began to fret and peak in her again, now
there was no longer constant outer stir and
movement to shut thought’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The necessity to touch dogs that will
sleep no longer is a hideous one, but it
must be dealt with.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen found this necessity a real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and absolute one, and no imaginary demand
that could be shelved, she faced it, and
proceeded to thrash out the ground with
an organized exhaustiveness, that was
almost brutal in its uncompromising frankness.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had gone through it all, by bits, in a
desultory way, several times since her home-coming.
This was unsatisfactory; the matter
must be laid out in its full bearings and
fundamentally cleared up. But the time
to do this was hard to find between callers
and calling.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon she was quite idle, however.
Humphrey was off attending a meeting
in the neighbouring town, and it was
snowing heavily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The most daring visitor must jib to-day!”
thought Gwen, “I shall claim it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>unreservedly, and I must have open air
for this business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her maid naturally thought her mad;
that mattered little. She was dressed and
right out in the storm in ten minutes
from the time she had taken her resolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>An old hound of Strange’s that had
taken to her from the first, was as much
scandalized as the maid, but he was not
the one to be outdone by any slip of a
girl. He gathered up his great legs,
shook himself with a drowsy grunt, and
followed her with a half-contemptuous
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Park had a certain beauty of its own,
it was big and, if its undulations were insignificant,
their curves were soft and full, and
the timber was magnificent and well-placed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the whole looked well under snow. The
great dull red-brick house stood out in
fine contrast to the dazzling white of the
earth, and the glittering green of the
clump of pines that flanked its left wing,
and from which the fierce wind kept
stripping the snow wreaths, that tried hard
to nestle in the shelter of the cosy
branches.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen got beyond the terraces
to a turn in the drive, she could see the
sluggish stream that ran through a mile
or so of the Park, turned into a torrent,
rushing and foaming onward in its brilliant
course.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stopped in the very teeth of the
storm, and looked round her with a radiant
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The whole place is transformed!” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>thought. “It generally reminds me of a
great soft white cow, chewing the cud
knee-deep in water in the shade of a full
silky beech, it has all that beast’s ample,
contented, intolerably depressing beauty;
but to-day it is grand, glorious, like anything
but a cow, the heart of it is alive
and throbbing under that driving storm,
it is the birth of passion in that suave
smooth green sod, and the snow is the
christening robe. Oh, I wish it were always
like this!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She threw off her veil and turned round,
that the blast might strike every part
of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s magnificent!” she shouted in her
excitement, “and—after all, passion’s a
wonderful thing!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed as she bent to the blast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“But it’s amazing the way it subsides
without leaving a token of its presence—what’s
a broken bough or two as a
witness to these wonders? In two days,
in less, this place will be as uncompromisingly
smooth and smug as ever.
Ah, passion is a fraud then, or else it
requires explanation!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She hurried on to the little ivy-covered
bridge that spanned the stream, and looked
down into the roaring seething waters
with laughing parted lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wanted to stay, the hurrying
foaming mass of unrest had a fascination
for her, but she dragged herself from it
and turned off from the drive on to a
narrow path that led to a sheltered wooded
glade about half a mile from the gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see the deer and the sheep have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>taken refuge there!” she said to herself,
“I suppose the fury of the storm goes
over their heads. I can think of nothing
I ought to here, I shall follow the deer.
Bran, what do you mean to do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She pointed significantly to the antlers
peeping through the snow-laden branches.
The hound gave a solemn nod. Seemingly
he understood her, at any rate he kept by
her side and refrained from sport for that
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she got to the trees she looked
round for a seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The snow on the ground was too soft
for sitting purposes, even for her reckless
strength to venture on, but she found at
last safe anchorage on a broad wooden
fence that skirted the grove, then she
turned all her senses in on herself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>She fixed her eyes advisedly on a peaceful
group of sheep, cuddled together on the lee
side of an old beech, as being less disturbing
to the mind than the tossing antlers
of the deer, and then she fell to meditation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To begin with,” she said, “I am
married. That is the one solid fact to argue
from. Into the bargain I was, I believe,
sane when I committed the deed which
is beyond recall, even on the plea of
insanity—that idea struck me once in the
early days with tremendous force. I must
then give up crying over spilt milk, it is
a degrading pursuit and offers no loophole
of escape, I must just face the future—ah,
my dear, that wrings your withers,
does it?” she muttered, as a cold shiver
ran down her spine.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Humphrey and I are playing at cross-purposes
now, that must be put a stop
to—well, perhaps it is as well to leave
that to time which will do the business
for him quite effectually. Ah, that picture!
That has deluded the man, he has
hampered himself with two wives—the
sooner he returns to monogamy, the
better for himself. This,” she said,
touching her breast, “this is as nothing
to that other! Men might fall down
before her and call her blessed; they
fall down before me, sure enough, but
they don’t call me blessed—quite the
contrary!—even Humphrey can’t go the
length of that, but fancy him before that
other! I wish I had never looked at her,
I shall get to hate her yet, she confuses
me, she complicates matters in the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>annoying way! Pah! I never intended to
dissect her to-day, why can’t I keep to
myself, me, who belongs body and soul—soul!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked down on herself with
curling lips, “Soul! Well, any soul I
have and <em>all</em> my body belongs to Humphrey
Strange, as sure as any horse in his
stable does. And he calls this thing wife
and loves it, loves it, bless you! and in a
most astonishing way. Then this wife,
she honours Humphrey Strange, she obeys
him, I have never gone contrary to him
in one solitary thing and I never will—that
is vulgar. But as for love! I don’t
love the man; I see every good point in
him; he dominates me in a way that is
simply horrible; but love him! Why, every
day it seems less possible to do it, yet it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>seems that one’s first and paramount duty
in this amazing contract is to love—and
now I have got to face this duty. How,
I wonder?—Am I to set diligently to fall
in love with this husband of mine, and
how? And how?” she cried, with a short
hard laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she stopped thinking, and looked
out on the whitened earth and the
sheep huddled together still closer
under a sudden sharp side blast, that
whisked round their shelter and set
the branches above them sighing and
moaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun had sunk further into the
West and had carried its glow away,
and the snow had lost its glitter. Gwen
shivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It chokes one to think of it!” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>said. Pulling her hands out of her muff,
and taking off her hat, she turned her
face to the blast, and let it beat her at
its savage will.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my hair—how heavy it is!”
she muttered, and began pulling out the
hairpins until the whole heavy mass fell
about her and was caught by the wind,
which shrieked with delight at its prize.
“Ah, that’s better! Well—now, this duty!
After all, it’s only sheer justice. I must,
must, must face it! If only an earthquake
would come into our lives, if I
were dying or Humphrey mortally wounded,
or if some catastrophe could fall on us,
in the general shock and upheaval something
might snap in me, some undiscovered
spring might burst up and I might
feel as duty demands! But in this everyday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>existence, in this flat country, among
the flatter squires and squiresses, nothing
ever happens, no one dies, no one gets
a mortal wound, there is never a sign of
an earthquake of any description, and yet
this duty stands out as clear and as
aggressive as ever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A strand of her long hair got caught
in a nail in the fence, she lingered over
the disentangling of it, then she turned
to Bran and had a little talk with him,
but the patient love in his eyes vexed
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go!” she said, giving him a little
shove with her foot, “go! You look
like that other woman! Oh, this duty,
this duty! Well, I will make one solitary
conscientious try at it, I will begin this
very day!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>She drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Touches and caresses and things of
that sort bring thrills and shakes and
trembles and flushes, every female novelist
assures one of that fact. Well, I must
practise touches and such, and hope for
results; also, I must not let myself shiver
and feel sick when I in my turn get
them bestowed upon me. I wish to goodness
I had thought of all this before, it
would have been far easier to have begun
right from the first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She suddenly hid her face in her
muff.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How awful that was, how awful!
oh!—gr—”</p>

<p class='c000'>She began to drum her feet with some
slight violence on the lower rail of the
fence and she beat her hands together—“to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>keep them warm,” she assured herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That picture person must be put down
and this, this,” she whispered, taking her
face with a sudden soft pathos between
her hands, “this must be brought forward,
made inevitable, so to speak;
then, then, perhaps, with time and custom
the other will be allowed to rest, and—rot!”
she cried sharply, lifting her face
and turning it again to the blast. “Ugh!
how vulgar I am, that painted creature
demoralizes me altogether! Ah, there
comes Humphrey, walking and leading his
horse, I will call him and launch out on
my duty. Look at him, it’s a wonder I
can say ‘No,’ to that ‘pulse’s magnificent
come and go!’ I can though, it
doesn’t move me the eighth of an
inch.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>She stood up on the fence and waved
her handkerchief to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, enter duty, exit vague speculation!”
she cried with a laugh, as she
jumped off the fence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Strange’s</span> horse had stood on a sharp
stump hidden by the snow and had lamed
himself, and they were both making the
best of their way to the house. It was
bad going, the fluttering snow kept constantly
balling in Lorraine’s hoofs. Any
attempt at hurry was out of the question,
so Strange’s thoughts turned, as they always
did in any unhurried moment, on his wife,
and the puzzle they were both dissecting.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“There is one thing,” he said with a
laugh, “we are not likely to pall on one
another in a hurry, there is nothing in
the least mawkish in our relations, and
we are both of us good-humoured. That
half-amused malice in her radiant face
whenever she catches me watching her!—Was
there ever before such radiance in
any woman’s face? This wife of mine is
superb, and yet I haven’t an atom of
claim to her, except from the law’s brutal
point of view. But the mistake was mine,
I thought it was in all women to be taught
to love, given a decent education, but it
seems there are some who want a special
dispensation to get it driven into them.
What a mystery the whole thing is! And
you try to do your duty, my poor little
girl, groping blindly in the cold outer air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of ignorance, and you think I know nothing
of your unrest and your wild endeavours!
How little you know after all, with all
your big brain! Hallo, there you are—yourself,
on the top of the fence, with
your hair flying! What hair it is! If
you were anyone else,” he shouted, “I
should see visions of colds and swollen
noses; you can laugh and dare anything.
Have you been long out?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She came up panting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since two o’clock. I had no idea I could
be moved to enthusiasm for this part of
the world. But this storm has rummaged
out every latent spark in me. Look at
those pines fighting the wind! Oh, oh,
my hat!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold Lorraine, I’ll catch it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen laughed gaily as she watched the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>chase. At first it was even betting between
the two, but in the end Strange brought
it back in triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t catch cold, but don’t you
think the dignity of your position in the
county demands a hat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it wants a hat as disreputable as
this to prop itself up with, it can’t be up
to much! By the way, what a united
couple the servants will think us, what a
striking picture of easy affection!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange laughed, but his wife could
have bitten out her tongue. After getting
nearly frozen to the fence in her zeal to
map out her duty, this to be the outcome
of it all!</p>

<p class='c000'>She began to speak quickly, and her
voice had a curious new little note in it
that interested her husband, and made him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>turn his eyes on her more than once.
But she was talking too fast to notice him,
then she had the wind to fight. Besides
all this, wild ideas of touches and such like
began to float about her brain in rather a
frantic way.</p>

<p class='c000'>She brought herself to reason with a
shake, fortunately perhaps, the time being
hardly fitting to launch out on any new line.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Gwen was coming down to tea
in a wonderful gown of white velvet with
slashes of crocus yellow, she met Tolly,
now the valet’s young man, carrying off
an armful of Strange’s wet clothes. By
some sudden impulse she stopped and
accosted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you will be happy here,” she
said, if the truth must be told, in rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>a shy way, the experience was so new
and shocking.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must try to keep away from
gin,” she added sagely, “and then you
will be sure to get on well. I know
your master wants you to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tolly gave a wild dab at his red mat
of stubble, muttered inarticulately and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, what made me do it, what? That
horror will haunt me for a week. What
is Humphrey made of that he can endure
the constant sight of him? And now I
remember, Mrs. Fellowes told me one day,
he nursed that awful thing for three weeks
once, because it whimpered at the thought
of a hospital. Imagine that mouth, that
nose, that ghastly whole, in delirium, oh
imagine the mere touch of those flabby
paws with their great red knobs—those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>knobs fascinated me and, ugh! they have
got into my eyes! Without doubt I have
a remarkable man for a husband! I wish,
oh, I wish I had my tea, I am dying
for it, I think I must be tired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She sank down into a big chair and
put her feet out to catch the heat, then
she put her hands up and set to to rub her
eyes, in a foolish futile effort to clear her
whirling brain, and then Strange and the
tea came in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have seen Tolly,” she said, giving
him some tea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that gown?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, that’s good, it may awaken some
sense of religion in the beggar. I have
experimented on him with every variety
of church, and with a most mixed assortment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of parsons, without the slightest
effect, but there is a certain divinity about
you in that gown that may appeal to the
fellow—be the thin edge of the wedge,
and lead to higher things. It would be
a new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> for you to pose in, Gwen, as
an instrument of grace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think I should do better as an
instrument of wrath,” she said, with rather
a strained smile; she felt a sudden impulse
of loathing against what Strange called
her “divinity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is one of the things which keeps
me so remote, so absolutely aloof,” she
thought hurriedly, “what do women
want with divinity or any other superhuman
attribute? I believe Rossetti
must have thought of me for his
‘Lilith’.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>She stood up half absently and looked
into a mirror near at hand, then she
moved away suddenly with sneering lips
and a quick flush.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s not the fire!” her husband
thought, “Oh Lord, what’s up now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>After a few minutes she went slowly
over to the piano, and began to play in
a vague fitful way. Her husband dropped
the paper he had taken up, and listened.
It struck him that her playing had altered,
it used to be mechanical and rather expressionless,
no one could accuse it of want
of expression to-night, even if the expression
did limit itself to anger and unrest.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time she stopped playing, with
one dissatisfied, disordered chord, then there
was a little pause which she broke by
singing, first softly and half humming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>then she seemed to awaken with a start,
and she sang on, song after song, with a
sort of excited vehemence. Her voice
was a low contralto, there was not a
sharp nor a hard tone in it, but there
were some strong harsh ones, like the
groans of men, and some deep guttural
ones, like the sighs of women; there was
no passion in her voice, but it was full
of consuming soft tumults of vague sad
unrest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is rather a pleasanter modification
of her first storms!” thought Strange.
“What possibilities there are in that voice,
I wonder what would happen if I went
over and tried to kiss that dead woman
into life! Pygmalion’s task was a fool to
mine, what’s marble to an undeveloped
woman!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>He stood behind her and joined in
with her song, his bass to her contralto.
The combination gave one rather a shock
at first, but it grew fascinating as they
went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stopped suddenly in the middle
of a song.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could not have believed our two
voices could ever mix and make completeness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a ‘sport’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I like explicable things best,” she said,
peering out into the semi-gloom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You go about with a scalpel in your
brain, Gwen! What a thing it is to come
of scientific stock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it’s a diabolical thing for a woman!”
said Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>She shut the piano up softly—she never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>by any chance banged things—and went
upstairs to dress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall wear that silk that looks like
flesh,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I put it away your ladyship, you said
you did not like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you could get at it quite easily, I
should like to wear it to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That dress suggests good sound flesh
and blood, with no remote divinity about
it,” she thought. “Oh, I wish I could
let things be, and stop poking about among
mysteries. I will touch him to-night, yes,
I will. I wonder—I wonder—if I can
possibly muster up strength for a kiss.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Fellowes</span>, meanwhile, was having
a most unsatisfactory time with the Park
people; it seemed absolutely impossible to
dig into them or to be of any service to
them. They were wearing her to skin and
bone, and she was meditating a change
somewhere or other, when one day,
crossing the hall just after lunch, she
heard a knock at the door and opened it
herself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>She found Mr. and Mrs. Waring standing
in their normal attitude and looking frightfully
embarrassed; she saw at a glance that
they looked queerer than usual, and not
feeling equal just at that minute to face
them alone, she carried them straight off
to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, I perceive,”
said Mr. Waring as soon as he
found himself in a chair, with his hat
grasped in one hand and the other on the
edge of his knee with the fingers stretched
out and feeling nervously in a baulked
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that last article of St. George
Mivart’s,” continued Mr. Waring, “we
find a marked evidence of the deteriorating
effect of any special bias on a man’s mind.
If this man were not an ardent churchman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of the Romish persuasion I have always
thought he might have done well in literary
science, but as it is—it seems to me he
has so much confused the thread of his
discourse as to render it comparatively
valueless by weaving into it, with most conscientious
persistence, stray fragments of
the deductions he has drawn from his own
crude creed. This demands, on the reader’s
part, a searching, sifting process, which the
intrinsic value of the gentleman’s articles
to my mind hardly warrants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, you like your science neat,” said
the rector, “so possibly might I, if I had
time to collect my own facts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but for work that must last, time
and an undivided mind are necessities, no
matter what the cause may be that clouds
the brain.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>He looked at his wife, and his floating,
near-sighted eyes grew dim with tender
pain, and the tendril-like movement of
his fingers increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>He forgot St. George Mivart, and all
at once it occurred to him why he had
come.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor old boy, his punishment is horribly
out of proportion to his deserts,” thought
the rector, as, in the pause that followed,
he caught snatches of the low-toned talk
of the women, with Gwen’s name entering
largely into it, and saw Mrs. Waring’s face
fixed on his own wife with pathetic shy
yearning, not veering round to her husband
with covert eagerness, as it used
to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fellowes caught himself echoing
the other husband’s sigh, and he laughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>as the absurdity of the situation struck him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This must be stopped,” he thought,
“it grows mawkish. I wonder if they
have forgotten to feed—more than likely.
Ruth, have you asked Mrs. Waring if she
has lunched?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed I haven’t!” she cried, “I
don’t know what I can have been thinking
about.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, please, Mrs. Fellowes,” stammered
the little woman, then her eyes turned
towards their magnet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring was at her side and with
her hand in his, with a speed that made
Mrs. Fellowes gasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The fact is, Mrs. Fellowes,” he explained
heroically, “we were both a
little forgetful, we—we—” he paused
painfully and gulped. “Ah!——I”—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>He repented the word sadly, it was
the first time his conscience had forced
him to separate the two, and it hurt him.
“Yes, I was much absorbed in my work—and
my wife, I think she is not very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite well, dear,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, dearest, I doubt it. I thought
some quinine might be beneficial, Mrs.
Fellowes. In fact, that was the primary
motive of our call.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give her some claret for the present,
and make her eat something, wine and
meat are as good as quinine any day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring was the most docile creature
breathing, she swallowed obediently everything
set before her, when suddenly a
little tremble ran all down her and shook
her gently, and she let her fork drop with
a little clash.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>She had caught sight just over the
sideboard of one of Brydon’s sketches
of Gwen, that she had sent Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband had not seen the picture,
so he only pressed her knife hand gently,
and murmured, “Nerves!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went back obediently to her meal,
and if they had given her the whole of
a chicken and a quart of claret, she would
have swallowed both without a murmur,
so long as they let her get finished and
go close up to that picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring’s meal, on the contrary, was
very interesting to him, and he enjoyed it
with a zest that set him playing at a
quite new and charming departure in classification.
A graceful pretty house-mother
moving on the field of his vision, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>supplying every unspoken want of his, was
a pleasing variation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A charming type, this serving woman,”
he reflected, regarding her with gentle
favour, “charming. By no means a unique
or even an unusual one, but really quite
charming and pleasant to observe. In that
woman the maternal instinct will be found
in a very advanced state of development—and
yet, if I recollect aright,” he started,
frowning, and pausing, with a morsel of
meat on his fork, he contemplated her
curiously, “Yes, I believe my recollections
are accurate, she has never had any children
and probably, after this lapse of
time, will not produce any. Very strange
indeed, very strange, another of those
most puzzling instances of Nature’s waste.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sighed and reflected a little on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Mrs. Fellowes as she helped his wife to
cream, then he went rather sadly to his
tart, feeling a slight tinge of contempt
for Nature’s inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mrs. Waring had consumed as
much nourishment as her entertainers
thought fit for her, Mr. Fellowes went
over to the sideboard, unhooked the sketch,
and propped it against the claret jug.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The colouring is good, isn’t it?”
he said. “Gwen sent it to us last
week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring threw up her head and
looked at the rector’s wife, then her face
flooded with pink, and there came a pain
into her heart that she had never felt before.
For the first time in her seven-and-thirty
years this little woman was jealous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen gave it!” she repeated. “Henry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>do you think Gwen would give us
one?”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a perceptible choke in her
voice, and she put up her little hand to
her throat with a swift movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My love!” he said in a rather frightened
way, “we could hardly ask our
daughter for such a very valuable present.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose we could not,” she said,
with sweet humility.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My reasonable, my docile one!” he
thought, with tender satisfaction, “better
a thousand times than any other female
type, serving or otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He might have felt more disturbed if
he had had the merest ghost of a notion
as to the causes of her humility, which had
less to do with him than he would
altogether have relished. With all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>congestion of novel emotion the woman
was losing her pristine transparency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are your plans for the afternoon?”
asked the rector. “You know that even
the ordinary decencies of civilization have
to be shunted in a parson’s life, I must
be off in five minutes. Are you on for a
walk, Waring?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I!—Oh, thank you, but, we—I—we—”
he caught nervously on to his wife’s eyes,
“we—we are very much engaged just
now. We just called concerning this matter
of quinine, and we have already absorbed
too much of your time; untimely visitors
are a keen trial—my wife and I have
suffered much from this form of affliction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rector laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Visitors are a brutal bane, ninety
per cent. of them, but you two are most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>marked exceptions. We can go as far
as the Park, anyway, for that is on my
way, and I know my wife has designs
on yours—you won’t get her back
much before dinner time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring turned round with a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this the case?” he asked blankly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would like to stay,” said Mrs. Waring
softly, but she hung her head and did not
look at her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her, however, and his
brows lifted themselves. He turned with
solemnity to Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pray consider this question of quinine,”
he said, “and let us know the result—our
experience is quite insufficient
to go on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are quite welcome to all mine,”
said Mrs. Fellowes laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>He turned to his wife again. “Good-bye,
my love. I hope I shall be able to get
on with my work, but—ahem—this upsets
one sadly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes went to her husband in
the hall just then and they were alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is quite unusual, love—are you
wise to remain?” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring’s eyes wandered to Gwen’s
picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would like to stay,” she said, then
suddenly she bent towards him and the
pink deepened on her cheeks, “but I will
go if you like.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you to do just as you like
yourself, love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He loosed his hand gently from her clasp
and followed Mrs. Fellowes into the hall,
his fingers twitching.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>In an instant she was after him and
making for her hat when Mrs. Fellowes
caught her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come to the door and see them off,”
she remarked innocently, drawing her arm
through her own.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had seen them off the premises,
Mrs. Fellowes shut her guest up
with the picture and went to dress, then
she scurried her off to the village, where
they spent a rather remarkable two hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes’ companion was first discovered
by an urchin who was making
mud pies in a gutter. At the first shock
of his find, he gave a whoop and turned
a summersault back into the dust, then he
uplifted himself and fled with the news,
despatching scouts to right and left on
his progress.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>When the ladies reached the village
they found it all agog, every door was
full of faces, and the howls of scrubbing
infancy arose from every yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring looked shy and twitched
a good deal, but on the whole she bore
herself gallantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mothers embarrassed her, they
seemed to expect conversation, and this
was even the case with the children;
she could just smile at them, however,
and be silent. It was among the babies
she shone, not, indeed, in her mode of holding
them—she did that with her fingers,
delicately, as if they were pens—but she
got so eager over them, so full of interest,
asked so many anxious questions as to
their appetites, and gave such amazing
hints concerning their management that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>she made an impression on the village
such as astonished the oldest inhabitant,
and set the women’s tongues wagging at
a rate to surprise even their husbands.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an event, an epoch-making day
in the village of Waring, when the squire’s
wife stepped in bodily presence in and
out of its houses, and disseminated useful
knowledge concerning the human infant.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen heard of it, in the same
letter that told her to send her mother a
sketch of herself without delay, she
laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is dishonest of Mrs. Fellowes!”
she cried with a little stamp, “how dare
she make all this fresh phase of lunacy
into a pathetic story? There is a ring of
false sentiment through the whole business.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
